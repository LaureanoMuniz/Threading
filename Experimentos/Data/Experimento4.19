one
arm
and
his
daughter
on
the
other
all
of
them
had
been
crying
a
little
grete
now
and
then
pressed
her
face
against
her
fathers
arm
leave
my
home
now
said
mr
samsa
indicating
the
door
and
without
letting
the
women
from
him
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
middle
of
the
three
gentlemen
somewhat
disconcerted
and
he
smiled
sweetly
the
other
two
held
their
hands
behind
their
backs
and
continually
rubbed
them
together
in
gleeful
anticipation
of
a
loud
quarrel
which
could
only
end
in
their
favour
i
mean
just
what
i
said
answered
mr
samsa
and
with
his
two
companions
went
in
a
straight
line
towards
the
man
at
first
he
stood
there
still
looking
at
the
ground
as
if
the
contents
of
his
head
were
rearranging
themselves
into
new
positions
alright
well
go
then
he
said
and
looked
up
at
mr
samsa
as
if
he
had
been
suddenly
overcome
with
humility
and
wanted
permission
again
from
mr
samsa
for
his
decision
mr
samsa
merely
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
briefly
nodded
to
him
several
times
at
that
and
without
delay
the
man
actually
did
take
long
strides
into
the
front
hallway
his
two
friends
had
stopped
rubbing
their
hands
some
time
before
and
had
been
listening
to
what
was
being
said
now
they
jumped
off
after
their
friend
as
if
taken
with
a
sudden
fear
that
mr
samsa
might
go
into
the
hallway
in
front
of
them
and
break
the
connection
with
their
leader
once
there
all
three
took
their
hats
from
the
stand
took
their
sticks
from
the
holder
bowed
without
a
word
and
left
the
premises
mr
samsa
and
the
two
women
followed
them
out
onto
the
landing
but
they
had
had
no
reason
to
mistrust
the
mens
intentions
and
as
they
leaned
over
the
landing
they
saw
how
the
three
gentlemen
made
slow
but
steady
progress
down
the
many
steps
as
they
turned
the
corner
on
each
floor
they
disappeared
and
would
reappear
a
few
moments
later
the
further
down
they
went
the
more
that
the
samsa
family
lost
interest
in
them
when
a
butchers
boy
proud
of
posture
with
his
tray
on
his
head
passed
them
on
his
way
up
and
came
nearer
than
they
were
mr
samsa
and
the
women
came
away
from
the
landing
and
went
as
if
relieved
back
into
the
flat
they
decided
the
best
way
to
make
use
of
that
day
was
for
relaxation
and
to
go
for
a
walk
not
only
had
they
earned
a
break
from
work
but
they
were
in
serious
need
of
it
so
they
sat
at
the
table
and
wrote
three
letters
of
excusal
mr
samsa
to
his
employers
mrs
samsa
to
her
contractor
and
grete
to
her
principal
the
cleaner
came
in
while
they
were
writing
to
tell
them
she
was
going
shed
finished
her
work
for
that
morning
the
three
of
them
at
first
just
nodded
without
looking
up
from
what
they
were
writing
and
it
was
only
when
the
cleaner
still
did
not
seem
to
want
to
leave
that
they
looked
up
in
irritation
well
asked
mr
samsa
the
charwoman
stood
in
the
doorway
with
a
smile
on
her
face
as
if
she
had
some
tremendous
good
news
to
report
but
would
only
do
it
if
she
was
clearly
asked
to
the
almost
vertical
little
ostrich
feather
on
her
hat
which
had
been
a
source
of
irritation
to
mr
samsa
all
the
time
she
had
been
working
for
them
swayed
gently
in
all
directions
what
is
it
you
want
then
asked
mrs
samsa
whom
the
cleaner
had
the
most
respect
for
yes
she
answered
and
broke
into
a
friendly
laugh
that
made
her
unable
to
speak
straight
away
well
then
that
thing
in
there
you
neednt
worry
about
how
youre
going
to
get
rid
of
it
thats
all
been
sorted
out
mrs
samsa
and
grete
bent
down
over
their
letters
as
if
intent
on
continuing
with
what
they
were
writing
mr
samsa
saw
that
the
cleaner
wanted
to
start
describing
everything
in
detail
but
with
outstretched
hand
he
made
it
quite
clear
that
she
was
not
to
so
as
she
was
prevented
from
telling
them
all
about
it
she
suddenly
remembered
what
a
hurry
she
was
in
and
clearly
peeved
called
out
cheerio
then
everyone
turned
round
sharply
and
left
slamming
the
door
terribly
as
she
went
tonight
she
gets
sacked
said
mr
samsa
but
he
received
no
reply
from
either
his
wife
or
his
daughter
as
the
charwoman
seemed
to
have
destroyed
the
peace
they
had
only
just
gained
they
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
window
where
they
remained
with
their
arms
around
each
other
mr
samsa
twisted
round
in
his
chair
to
look
at
them
and
sat
there
watching
for
a
while
then
he
called
out
come
here
then
lets
forget
about
all
that
old
stuff
shall
we
come
and
give
me
a
bit
of
attention
the
two
women
immediately
did
as
he
said
hurrying
over
to
him
where
they
kissed
him
and
hugged
him
and
then
they
quickly
finished
their
letters
after
that
the
three
of
them
left
the
flat
together
which
was
something
they
had
not
done
for
months
and
took
the
tram
out
to
the
open
country
outside
the
town
they
had
the
tram
filled
with
warm
sunshine
all
to
themselves
leant
back
comfortably
on
their
seats
they
discussed
their
prospects
and
found
that
on
closer
examination
they
were
not
at
all
bad

until
then
they
had
never
asked
each
other
about
their
work
but
all
three
had
jobs
which
were
very
good
and
held
particularly
good
promise
for
the
future
the
greatest
improvement
for
the
time
being
of
course
would
be
achieved
quite
easily
by
moving
house
what
they
needed
now
was
a
flat
that
was
smaller
and
cheaper
than
the
current
one
which
had
been
chosen
by
gregor
one
that
was
in
a
better
location
and
most
of
all
more
practical
all
the
time
grete
was
becoming
livelier
with
all
the
worry
they
had
been
having
of
late
her
cheeks
had
become
pale
but
while
they
were
talking
mr
and
mrs
samsa
were
struck
almost
simultaneously
with
the
thought
of
how
their
daughter
was
blossoming
into
a
well
built
and
beautiful
young
lady
they
became
quieter
just
from
each
others
glance
and
almost
without
knowing
it
they
agreed
that
it
would
soon
be
time
to
find
a
good
man
for
her
and
as
if
in
confirmation
of
their
new
dreams
and
good
intentions
as
soon
as
they
reached
their
destination
grete
was
the
first
to
get
up
and
stretch
out
her
young
body
