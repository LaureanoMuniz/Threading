pressure
from
her
father
the
three
gentlemen
were
more
quickly
moving
toward
under
his
sisters
experienced
hand
the
pillows
and
covers
on
the
beds
flew
up
and
were
put
into
order
and
she
had
already
finished
making
the
beds
and
slipped
out
again
before
the
three
gentlemen
had
reached
the
room
gregors
father
seemed
so
obsessed
with
what
he
was
doing
that
he
forgot
all
the
respect
he
owed
to
his
tenants
he
urged
them
and
pressed
them
until
when
he
was
already
at
the
door
of
the
room
the
middle
of
the
three
gentlemen
shouted
like
thunder
and
stamped
his
foot
and
thereby
brought
gregors
father
to
a
halt
i
declare
here
and
now
he
said
raising
his
hand
and
glancing
at
gregors
mother
and
sister
to
gain
their
attention
too
that
with
regard
to
the
repugnant
conditions
that
prevail
in
this
flat
and
with
this
family

here
he
looked
briefly
but
decisively
at
the
floor

i
give
immediate
notice
on
my
room
for
the
days
that
i
have
been
living
here
i
will
of
course
pay
nothing
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
will
consider
whether
to
proceed
with
some
kind
of
action
for
damages
from
you
and
believe
me
it
would
be
very
easy
to
set
out
the
grounds
for
such
an
action
he
was
silent
and
looked
straight
ahead
as
if
waiting
for
something
and
indeed
his
two
friends
joined
in
with
the
words
and
we
also
give
immediate
notice
with
that
he
took
hold
of
the
door
handle
and
slammed
the
door
gregors
father
staggered
back
to
his
seat
feeling
his
way
with
his
hands
and
fell
into
it
it
looked
as
if
he
was
stretching
himself
out
for
his
usual
evening
nap
but
from
the
uncontrolled
way
his
head
kept
nodding
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
not
sleeping
at
all
throughout
all
this
gregor
had
lain
still
where
the
three
gentlemen
had
first
seen
him
his
disappointment
at
the
failure
of
his
plan
and
perhaps
also
because
he
was
weak
from
hunger
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
move
he
was
sure
that
everyone
would
turn
on
him
any
moment
and
he
waited
he
was
not
even
startled
out
of
this
state
when
the
violin
on
his
mothers
lap
fell
from
her
trembling
fingers
and
landed
loudly
on
the
floor
father
mother
said
his
sister
hitting
the
table
with
her
hand
as
introduction
we
cant
carry
on
like
this
maybe
you
cant
see
it
but
i
can
i
dont
want
to
call
this
monster
my
brother
all
i
can
say
is
we
have
to
try
and
get
rid
of
it
weve
done
all
thats
humanly
possible
to
look
after
it
and
be
patient
i
dont
think
anyone
could
accuse
us
of
doing
anything
wrong
shes
absolutely
right
said
gregors
father
to
himself
his
mother
who
still
had
not
had
time
to
catch
her
breath
began
to
cough
dully
her
hand
held
out
in
front
of
her
and
a
deranged
expression
in
her
eyes
gregors
sister
rushed
to
his
mother
and
put
her
hand
on
her
forehead
her
words
seemed
to
give
gregors
father
some
more
definite
ideas
he
sat
upright
played
with
his
uniform
cap
between
the
plates
left
by
the
three
gentlemen
after
their
meal
and
occasionally
looked
down
at
gregor
as
he
lay
there
immobile
we
have
to
try
and
get
rid
of
it
said
gregors
sister
now
speaking
only
to
her
father
as
her
mother
was
too
occupied
with
coughing
to
listen
itll
be
the
death
of
both
of
you
i
can
see
it
coming
we
cant
all
work
as
hard
as
we
have
to
and
then
come
home
to
be
tortured
like
this
we
cant
endure
it
i
cant
endure
it
any
more
and
she
broke
out
so
heavily
in
tears
that
they
flowed
down
the
face
of
her
mother
and
she
wiped
them
away
with
mechanical
hand
movements
my
child
said
her
father
with
sympathy
and
obvious
understanding
what
are
we
to
do
his
sister
just
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
a
sign
of
the
helplessness
and
tears
that
had
taken
hold
of
her
displacing
her
earlier
certainty
if
he
could
just
understand
us
said
his
father
almost
as
a
question
his
sister
shook
her
hand
vigorously
through
her
tears
as
a
sign
that
of
that
there
was
no
question
if
he
could
just
understand
us
repeated
gregors
father
closing
his
eyes
in
acceptance
of
his
sisters
certainty
that
that
was
quite
impossible
then
perhaps
we
could
come
to
some
kind
of
arrangement
with
him
but
as
it
is

its
got
to
go
shouted
his
sister
thats
the
only
way
father
youve
got
to
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
thats
gregor
weve
only
harmed
ourselves
by
believing
it
for
so
long
how
can
that
be
gregor
if
it
were
gregor
he
would
have
seen
long
ago
that
its
not
possible
for
human
beings
to
live
with
an
animal
like
that
and
he
would
have
gone
of
his
own
free
will
we
wouldnt
have
a
brother
any
more
then
but
we
could
carry
on
with
our
lives
and
remember
him
with
respect
as
it
is
this
animal
is
persecuting
us
its
driven
out
our
tenants
it
obviously
wants
to
take
over
the
whole
flat
and
force
us
to
sleep
on
the
streets
father
look
just
look
she
suddenly
screamed
hes
starting
again
in
her
alarm
which
was
totally
beyond
gregors
comprehension
his
sister
even
abandoned
his
mother
as
she
pushed
herself
vigorously
out
of
her
chair
as
if
more
willing
to
sacrifice
her
own
mother
than
stay
anywhere
near
gregor
she
rushed
over
to
behind
her
father
who
had
become
excited
merely
because
she
was
and
stood
up
half
raising
his
hands
in
front
of
gregors
sister
as
if
to
protect
her
but
gregor
had
had
no
intention
of
frightening
anyone
least
of
all
his
sister
all
he
had
done
was
begin
to
turn
round
so
that
he
could
go
back
into
his
room
although
that
was
in
itself
quite
startling
as
his
painwracked
condition
meant
that
turning
round
required
a
great
deal
of
effort
and
he
was
using
his
head
to
help
himself
do
it
repeatedly
raising
it
and
striking
it
against
the
floor
he
stopped
and
looked
round
they
seemed
to
have
realised
his
good
intention
and
had
only
been
alarmed
briefly
now
they
all
looked
at
him
in
unhappy
silence
his
mother
lay
in
her
chair
with
her
legs
stretched
out
and
pressed
against
each
other
her
eyes
nearly
closed
with
exhaustion
his
sister
sat
next
to
his
father
with
her
arms
around
his
neck
maybe
