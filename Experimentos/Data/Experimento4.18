now
theyll
let
me
turn
round
thought
gregor
and
went
back
to
work
he
could
not
help
panting
loudly
with
the
effort
and
had
sometimes
to
stop
and
take
a
rest
noone
was
making
him
rush
any
more
everything
was
left
up
to
him
as
soon
as
he
had
finally
finished
turning
round
he
began
to
move
straight
ahead
he
was
amazed
at
the
great
distance
that
separated
him
from
his
room
and
could
not
understand
how
he
had
covered
that
distance
in
his
weak
state
a
little
while
before
and
almost
without
noticing
it
he
concentrated
on
crawling
as
fast
as
he
could
and
hardly
noticed
that
there
was
not
a
word
not
any
cry
from
his
family
to
distract
him
he
did
not
turn
his
head
until
he
had
reached
the
doorway
he
did
not
turn
it
all
the
way
round
as
he
felt
his
neck
becoming
stiff
but
it
was
nonetheless
enough
to
see
that
nothing
behind
him
had
changed
only
his
sister
had
stood
up
with
his
last
glance
he
saw
that
his
mother
had
now
fallen
completely
asleep
he
was
hardly
inside
his
room
before
the
door
was
hurriedly
shut
bolted
and
locked
the
sudden
noise
behind
gregor
so
startled
him
that
his
little
legs
collapsed
under
him
it
was
his
sister
who
had
been
in
so
much
of
a
rush
she
had
been
standing
there
waiting
and
sprung
forward
lightly
gregor
had
not
heard
her
coming
at
all
and
as
she
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
she
said
loudly
to
her
parents
at
last
what
now
then
gregor
asked
himself
as
he
looked
round
in
the
darkness
he
soon
made
the
discovery
that
he
could
no
longer
move
at
all
this
was
no
surprise
to
him
it
seemed
rather
that
being
able
to
actually
move
around
on
those
spindly
little
legs
until
then
was
unnatural
he
also
felt
relatively
comfortable
it
is
true
that
his
entire
body
was
aching
but
the
pain
seemed
to
be
slowly
getting
weaker
and
weaker
and
would
finally
disappear
altogether
he
could
already
hardly
feel
the
decayed
apple
in
his
back
or
the
inflamed
area
around
it
which
was
entirely
covered
in
white
dust
he
thought
back
of
his
family
with
emotion
and
love
if
it
was
possible
he
felt
that
he
must
go
away
even
more
strongly
than
his
sister
he
remained
in
this
state
of
empty
and
peaceful
rumination
until
he
heard
the
clock
tower
strike
three
in
the
morning
he
watched
as
it
slowly
began
to
get
light
everywhere
outside
the
window
too
then
without
his
willing
it
his
head
sank
down
completely
and
his
last
breath
flowed
weakly
from
his
nostrils
when
the
cleaner
came
in
early
in
the
morning

theyd
often
asked
her
not
to
keep
slamming
the
doors
but
with
her
strength
and
in
her
hurry
she
still
did
so
that
everyone
in
the
flat
knew
when
shed
arrived
and
from
then
on
it
was
impossible
to
sleep
in
peace

she
made
her
usual
brief
look
in
on
gregor
and
at
first
found
nothing
special
she
thought
he
was
laying
there
so
still
on
purpose
playing
the
martyr
she
attributed
all
possible
understanding
to
him
she
happened
to
be
holding
the
long
broom
in
her
hand
so
she
tried
to
tickle
gregor
with
it
from
the
doorway
when
she
had
no
success
with
that
she
tried
to
make
a
nuisance
of
herself
and
poked
at
him
a
little
and
only
when
she
found
she
could
shove
him
across
the
floor
with
no
resistance
at
all
did
she
start
to
pay
attention
she
soon
realised
what
had
really
happened
opened
her
eyes
wide
whistled
to
herself
but
did
not
waste
time
to
yank
open
the
bedroom
doors
and
shout
loudly
into
the
darkness
of
the
bedrooms
come
and
ave
a
look
at
this
its
dead
just
lying
there
stone
dead
mr
and
mrs
samsa
sat
upright
there
in
their
marriage
bed
and
had
to
make
an
effort
to
get
over
the
shock
caused
by
the
cleaner
before
they
could
grasp
what
she
was
saying
but
then
each
from
his
own
side
they
hurried
out
of
bed
mr
samsa
threw
the
blanket
over
his
shoulders
mrs
samsa
just
came
out
in
her
nightdress
and
that
is
how
they
went
into
gregors
room
on
the
way
they
opened
the
door
to
the
living
room
where
grete
had
been
sleeping
since
the
three
gentlemen
had
moved
in
she
was
fully
dressed
as
if
she
had
never
been
asleep
and
the
paleness
of
her
face
seemed
to
confirm
this
dead
asked
mrs
samsa
looking
at
the
charwoman
enquiringly
even
though
she
could
have
checked
for
herself
and
could
have
known
it
even
without
checking
thats
what
i
said
replied
the
cleaner
and
to
prove
it
she
gave
gregors
body
another
shove
with
the
broom
sending
it
sideways
across
the
floor
mrs
samsa
made
a
movement
as
if
she
wanted
to
hold
back
the
broom
but
did
not
complete
it
now
then
said
mr
samsa
lets
give
thanks
to
god
for
that
he
crossed
himself
and
the
three
women
followed
his
example
grete
who
had
not
taken
her
eyes
from
the
corpse
said
just
look
how
thin
he
was
he
didnt
eat
anything
for
so
long
the
food
came
out
again
just
the
same
as
when
it
went
in
gregors
body
was
indeed
completely
dried
up
and
flat
they
had
not
seen
it
until
then
but
now
he
was
not
lifted
up
on
his
little
legs
nor
did
he
do
anything
to
make
them
look
away
grete
come
with
us
in
here
for
a
little
while
said
mrs
samsa
with
a
pained
smile
and
grete
followed
her
parents
into
the
bedroom
but
not
without
looking
back
at
the
body
the
cleaner
shut
the
door
and
opened
the
window
wide
although
it
was
still
early
in
the
morning
the
fresh
air
had
something
of
warmth
mixed
in
with
it
it
was
already
the
end
of
march
after
all
the
three
gentlemen
stepped
out
of
their
room
and
looked
round
in
amazement
for
their
breakfasts
they
had
been
forgotten
about
where
is
our
breakfast
the
middle
gentleman
asked
the
cleaner
irritably
she
just
put
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
made
a
quick
and
silent
sign
to
the
men
that
they
might
like
to
come
into
gregors
room
they
did
so
and
stood
around
gregors
corpse
with
their
hands
in
the
pockets
of
their
wellworn
coats
it
was
now
quite
light
in
the
room
then
the
door
of
the
bedroom
opened
and
mr
samsa
appeared
in
his
uniform
with
his
wife
on
