the
violin
began
playing
they
became
attentive
stood
up
and
went
on
tiptoe
over
to
the
door
of
the
hallway
where
they
stood
pressed
against
each
other
someone
must
have
heard
them
in
the
kitchen
as
gregors
father
called
out
is
the
playing
perhaps
unpleasant
for
the
gentlemen
we
can
stop
it
straight
away
on
the
contrary
said
the
middle
gentleman
would
the
young
lady
not
like
to
come
in
and
play
for
us
here
in
the
room
where
it
is
after
all
much
more
cosy
and
comfortable
oh
yes
wed
love
to
called
back
gregors
father
as
if
he
had
been
the
violin
player
himself
the
gentlemen
stepped
back
into
the
room
and
waited
gregors
father
soon
appeared
with
the
music
stand
his
mother
with
the
music
and
his
sister
with
the
violin
she
calmly
prepared
everything
for
her
to
begin
playing
his
parents
who
had
never
rented
a
room
out
before
and
therefore
showed
an
exaggerated
courtesy
towards
the
three
gentlemen
did
not
even
dare
to
sit
on
their
own
chairs
his
father
leant
against
the
door
with
his
right
hand
pushed
in
between
two
buttons
on
his
uniform
coat
his
mother
though
was
offered
a
seat
by
one
of
the
gentlemen
and
sat

leaving
the
chair
where
the
gentleman
happened
to
have
placed
it

out
of
the
way
in
a
corner
his
sister
began
to
play
father
and
mother
paid
close
attention
one
on
each
side
to
the
movements
of
her
hands
drawn
in
by
the
playing
gregor
had
dared
to
come
forward
a
little
and
already
had
his
head
in
the
living
room
before
he
had
taken
great
pride
in
how
considerate
he
was
but
now
it
hardly
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
become
so
thoughtless
about
the
others
whats
more
there
was
now
all
the
more
reason
to
keep
himself
hidden
as
he
was
covered
in
the
dust
that
lay
everywhere
in
his
room
and
flew
up
at
the
slightest
movement
he
carried
threads
hairs
and
remains
of
food
about
on
his
back
and
sides
he
was
much
too
indifferent
to
everything
now
to
lay
on
his
back
and
wipe
himself
on
the
carpet
like
he
had
used
to
do
several
times
a
day
and
despite
this
condition
he
was
not
too
shy
to
move
forward
a
little
onto
the
immaculate
floor
of
the
living
room
noone
noticed
him
though
the
family
was
totally
preoccupied
with
the
violin
playing
at
first
the
three
gentlemen
had
put
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
come
up
far
too
close
behind
the
music
stand
to
look
at
all
the
notes
being
played
and
they
must
have
disturbed
gregors
sister
but
soon
in
contrast
with
the
family
they
withdrew
back
to
the
window
with
their
heads
sunk
and
talking
to
each
other
at
half
volume
and
they
stayed
by
the
window
while
gregors
father
observed
them
anxiously
it
really
now
seemed
very
obvious
that
they
had
expected
to
hear
some
beautiful
or
entertaining
violin
playing
but
had
been
disappointed
that
they
had
had
enough
of
the
whole
performance
and
it
was
only
now
out
of
politeness
that
they
allowed
their
peace
to
be
disturbed
it
was
especially
unnerving
the
way
they
all
blew
the
smoke
from
their
cigarettes
upwards
from
their
mouth
and
noses
yet
gregors
sister
was
playing
so
beautifully
her
face
was
leant
to
one
side
following
the
lines
of
music
with
a
careful
and
melancholy
expression
gregor
crawled
a
little
further
forward
keeping
his
head
close
to
the
ground
so
that
he
could
meet
her
eyes
if
the
chance
came
was
he
an
animal
if
music
could
captivate
him
so
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
being
shown
the
way
to
the
unknown
nourishment
he
had
been
yearning
for
he
was
determined
to
make
his
way
forward
to
his
sister
and
tug
at
her
skirt
to
show
her
she
might
come
into
his
room
with
her
violin
as
noone
appreciated
her
playing
here
as
much
as
he
would
he
never
wanted
to
let
her
out
of
his
room
not
while
he
lived
anyway
his
shocking
appearance
should
for
once
be
of
some
use
to
him
he
wanted
to
be
at
every
door
of
his
room
at
once
to
hiss
and
spit
at
the
attackers
his
sister
should
not
be
forced
to
stay
with
him
though
but
stay
of
her
own
free
will
she
would
sit
beside
him
on
the
couch
with
her
ear
bent
down
to
him
while
he
told
her
how
he
had
always
intended
to
send
her
to
the
conservatory
how
he
would
have
told
everyone
about
it
last
christmas

had
christmas
really
come
and
gone
already

if
this
misfortune
hadnt
got
in
the
way
and
refuse
to
let
anyone
dissuade
him
from
it
on
hearing
all
this
his
sister
would
break
out
in
tears
of
emotion
and
gregor
would
climb
up
to
her
shoulder
and
kiss
her
neck
which
since
she
had
been
going
out
to
work
she
had
kept
free
without
any
necklace
or
collar
mr
samsa
shouted
the
middle
gentleman
to
gregors
father
pointing
without
wasting
any
more
words
with
his
forefinger
at
gregor
as
he
slowly
moved
forward
the
violin
went
silent
the
middle
of
the
three
gentlemen
first
smiled
at
his
two
friends
shaking
his
head
and
then
looked
back
at
gregor
his
father
seemed
to
think
it
more
important
to
calm
the
three
gentlemen
before
driving
gregor
out
even
though
they
were
not
at
all
upset
and
seemed
to
think
gregor
was
more
entertaining
than
the
violin
playing
had
been
he
rushed
up
to
them
with
his
arms
spread
out
and
attempted
to
drive
them
back
into
their
room
at
the
same
time
as
trying
to
block
their
view
of
gregor
with
his
body
now
they
did
become
a
little
annoyed
and
it
was
not
clear
whether
it
was
his
fathers
behaviour
that
annoyed
them
or
the
dawning
realisation
that
they
had
had
a
neighbour
like
gregor
in
the
next
room
without
knowing
it
they
asked
gregors
father
for
explanations
raised
their
arms
like
he
had
tugged
excitedly
at
their
beards
and
moved
back
towards
their
room
only
very
slowly
meanwhile
gregors
sister
had
overcome
the
despair
she
had
fallen
into
when
her
playing
was
suddenly
interrupted
she
had
let
her
hands
drop
and
let
violin
and
bow
hang
limply
for
a
while
but
continued
to
look
at
the
music
as
if
still
playing
but
then
she
suddenly
pulled
herself
together
lay
the
instrument
on
her
mothers
lap
who
still
sat
laboriously
struggling
for
breath
where
she
was
and
ran
into
the
next
room
which
under
