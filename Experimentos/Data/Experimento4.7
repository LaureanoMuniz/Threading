of
it
gregor
went
and
waited
immediately
by
the
door
resolved
either
to
bring
the
timorous
visitor
into
the
room
in
some
way
or
at
least
to
find
out
who
it
was
but
the
door
was
opened
no
more
that
night
and
gregor
waited
in
vain
the
previous
morning
while
the
doors
were
locked
everyone
had
wanted
to
get
in
there
to
him
but
now
now
that
he
had
opened
up
one
of
the
doors
and
the
other
had
clearly
been
unlocked
some
time
during
the
day
noone
came
and
the
keys
were
in
the
other
sides
it
was
not
until
late
at
night
that
the
gaslight
in
the
living
room
was
put
out
and
now
it
was
easy
to
see
that
his
parents
and
sister
had
stayed
awake
all
that
time
as
they
all
could
be
distinctly
heard
as
they
went
away
together
on
tiptoe
it
was
clear
that
noone
would
come
into
gregors
room
any
more
until
morning
that
gave
him
plenty
of
time
to
think
undisturbed
about
how
he
would
have
to
rearrange
his
life
for
some
reason
the
tall
empty
room
where
he
was
forced
to
remain
made
him
feel
uneasy
as
he
lay
there
flat
on
the
floor
even
though
he
had
been
living
in
it
for
five
years
hardly
aware
of
what
he
was
doing
other
than
a
slight
feeling
of
shame
he
hurried
under
the
couch
it
pressed
down
on
his
back
a
little
and
he
was
no
longer
able
to
lift
his
head
but
he
nonetheless
felt
immediately
at
ease
and
his
only
regret
was
that
his
body
was
too
broad
to
get
it
all
underneath
he
spent
the
whole
night
there
some
of
the
time
he
passed
in
a
light
sleep
although
he
frequently
woke
from
it
in
alarm
because
of
his
hunger
and
some
of
the
time
was
spent
in
worries
and
vague
hopes
which
however
always
led
to
the
same
conclusion
for
the
time
being
he
must
remain
calm
he
must
show
patience
and
the
greatest
consideration
so
that
his
family
could
bear
the
unpleasantness
that
he
in
his
present
condition
was
forced
to
impose
on
them
gregor
soon
had
the
opportunity
to
test
the
strength
of
his
decisions
as
early
the
next
morning
almost
before
the
night
had
ended
his
sister
nearly
fully
dressed
opened
the
door
from
the
front
room
and
looked
anxiously
in
she
did
not
see
him
straight
away
but
when
she
did
notice
him
under
the
couch

he
had
to
be
somewhere
for
gods
sake
he
couldnt
have
flown
away

she
was
so
shocked
that
she
lost
control
of
herself
and
slammed
the
door
shut
again
from
outside
but
she
seemed
to
regret
her
behaviour
as
she
opened
the
door
again
straight
away
and
came
in
on
tiptoe
as
if
entering
the
room
of
someone
seriously
ill
or
even
of
a
stranger
gregor
had
pushed
his
head
forward
right
to
the
edge
of
the
couch
and
watched
her
would
she
notice
that
he
had
left
the
milk
as
it
was
realise
that
it
was
not
from
any
lack
of
hunger
and
bring
him
in
some
other
food
that
was
more
suitable
if
she
didnt
do
it
herself
he
would
rather
go
hungry
than
draw
her
attention
to
it
although
he
did
feel
a
terrible
urge
to
rush
forward
from
under
the
couch
throw
himself
at
his
sisters
feet
and
beg
her
for
something
good
to
eat
however
his
sister
noticed
the
full
dish
immediately
and
looked
at
it
and
the
few
drops
of
milk
splashed
around
it
with
some
surprise
she
immediately
picked
it
up

using
a
rag
not
her
bare
hands

and
carried
it
out
gregor
was
extremely
curious
as
to
what
she
would
bring
in
its
place
imagining
the
wildest
possibilities
but
he
never
could
have
guessed
what
his
sister
in
her
goodness
actually
did
bring
in
order
to
test
his
taste
she
brought
him
a
whole
selection
of
things
all
spread
out
on
an
old
newspaper
there
were
old
halfrotten
vegetables
bones
from
the
evening
meal
covered
in
white
sauce
that
had
gone
hard
a
few
raisins
and
almonds
some
cheese
that
gregor
had
declared
inedible
two
days
before
a
dry
roll
and
some
bread
spread
with
butter
and
salt
as
well
as
all
that
she
had
poured
some
water
into
the
dish
which
had
probably
been
permanently
set
aside
for
gregors
use
and
placed
it
beside
them
then
out
of
consideration
for
gregors
feelings
as
she
knew
that
he
would
not
eat
in
front
of
her
she
hurried
out
again
and
even
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
so
that
gregor
would
know
he
could
make
things
as
comfortable
for
himself
as
he
liked
gregors
little
legs
whirred
at
last
he
could
eat
whats
more
his
injuries
must
already
have
completely
healed
as
he
found
no
difficulty
in
moving
this
amazed
him
as
more
than
a
month
earlier
he
had
cut
his
finger
slightly
with
a
knife
he
thought
of
how
his
finger
had
still
hurt
the
day
before
yesterday
am
i
less
sensitive
than
i
used
to
be
then
he
thought
and
was
already
sucking
greedily
at
the
cheese
which
had
immediately
almost
compellingly
attracted
him
much
more
than
the
other
foods
on
the
newspaper
quickly
one
after
another
his
eyes
watering
with
pleasure
he
consumed
the
cheese
the
vegetables
and
the
sauce
the
fresh
foods
on
the
other
hand
he
didnt
like
at
all
and
even
dragged
the
things
he
did
want
to
eat
a
little
way
away
from
them
because
he
couldnt
stand
the
smell
long
after
he
had
finished
eating
and
lay
lethargic
in
the
same
place
his
sister
slowly
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
as
a
sign
to
him
that
he
should
withdraw
he
was
immediately
startled
although
he
had
been
half
asleep
and
he
hurried
back
under
the
couch
but
he
needed
great
selfcontrol
to
stay
there
even
for
the
short
time
that
his
sister
was
in
the
room
as
eating
so
much
food
had
rounded
out
his
body
a
little
and
he
could
hardly
breathe
in
that
narrow
space
half
suffocating
he
watched
with
bulging
eyes
as
his
sister
unselfconsciously
took
a
broom
and
swept
up
the
leftovers
mixing
them
in
with
the
food
he
had
not
even
touched
at
all
as
if
it
could
not
be
used
any
more
she
quickly
dropped
it
all
into
a
bin
closed
it
with
its
wooden
lid
and
carried
everything
out
she
had
hardly
turned
her
back
before
gregor
came
out
again
from
under
the
couch
and
stretched
himself
this
was
how
gregor
received
his
