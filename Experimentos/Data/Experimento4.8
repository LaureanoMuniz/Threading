food
each
day
now
once
in
the
morning
while
his
parents
and
the
maid
were
still
asleep
and
the
second
time
after
everyone
had
eaten
their
meal
at
midday
as
his
parents
would
sleep
for
a
little
while
then
as
well
and
gregors
sister
would
send
the
maid
away
on
some
errand
gregors
father
and
mother
certainly
did
not
want
him
to
starve
either
but
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
than
they
could
stand
to
have
any
more
experience
of
his
feeding
than
being
told
about
it
and
perhaps
his
sister
wanted
to
spare
them
what
distress
she
could
as
they
were
indeed
suffering
enough
it
was
impossible
for
gregor
to
find
out
what
they
had
told
the
doctor
and
the
locksmith
that
first
morning
to
get
them
out
of
the
flat
as
nobody
could
understand
him
nobody
not
even
his
sister
thought
that
he
could
understand
them
so
he
had
to
be
content
to
hear
his
sisters
sighs
and
appeals
to
the
saints
as
she
moved
about
his
room
it
was
only
later
when
she
had
become
a
little
more
used
to
everything

there
was
of
course
no
question
of
her
ever
becoming
fully
used
to
the
situation

that
gregor
would
sometimes
catch
a
friendly
comment
or
at
least
a
comment
that
could
be
construed
as
friendly
hes
enjoyed
his
dinner
today
she
might
say
when
he
had
diligently
cleared
away
all
the
food
left
for
him
or
if
he
left
most
of
it
which
slowly
became
more
and
more
frequent
she
would
often
say
sadly
now
everythings
just
been
left
there
again
although
gregor
wasnt
able
to
hear
any
news
directly
he
did
listen
to
much
of
what
was
said
in
the
next
rooms
and
whenever
he
heard
anyone
speaking
he
would
scurry
straight
to
the
appropriate
door
and
press
his
whole
body
against
it
there
was
seldom
any
conversation
especially
at
first
that
was
not
about
him
in
some
way
even
if
only
in
secret
for
two
whole
days
all
the
talk
at
every
mealtime
was
about
what
they
should
do
now
but
even
between
meals
they
spoke
about
the
same
subject
as
there
were
always
at
least
two
members
of
the
family
at
home

nobody
wanted
to
be
at
home
by
themselves
and
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
leave
the
flat
entirely
empty
and
on
the
very
first
day
the
maid
had
fallen
to
her
knees
and
begged
gregors
mother
to
let
her
go
without
delay
it
was
not
very
clear
how
much
she
knew
of
what
had
happened
but
she
left
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
tearfully
thanking
gregors
mother
for
her
dismissal
as
if
she
had
done
her
an
enormous
service
she
even
swore
emphatically
not
to
tell
anyone
the
slightest
about
what
had
happened
even
though
noone
had
asked
that
of
her
now
gregors
sister
also
had
to
help
his
mother
with
the
cooking
although
that
was
not
so
much
bother
as
noone
ate
very
much
gregor
often
heard
how
one
of
them
would
unsuccessfully
urge
another
to
eat
and
receive
no
more
answer
than
no
thanks
ive
had
enough
or
something
similar
noone
drank
very
much
either
his
sister
would
sometimes
ask
his
father
whether
he
would
like
a
beer
hoping
for
the
chance
to
go
and
fetch
it
herself
when
his
father
then
said
nothing
she
would
add
so
that
he
would
not
feel
selfish
that
she
could
send
the
housekeeper
for
it
but
then
his
father
would
close
the
matter
with
a
big
loud
no
and
no
more
would
be
said
even
before
the
first
day
had
come
to
an
end
his
father
had
explained
to
gregors
mother
and
sister
what
their
finances
and
prospects
were
now
and
then
he
stood
up
from
the
table
and
took
some
receipt
or
document
from
the
little
cash
box
he
had
saved
from
his
business
when
it
had
collapsed
five
years
earlier
gregor
heard
how
he
opened
the
complicated
lock
and
then
closed
it
again
after
he
had
taken
the
item
he
wanted
what
he
heard
his
father
say
was
some
of
the
first
good
news
that
gregor
heard
since
he
had
first
been
incarcerated
in
his
room
he
had
thought
that
nothing
at
all
remained
from
his
fathers
business
at
least
he
had
never
told
him
anything
different
and
gregor
had
never
asked
him
about
it
anyway
their
business
misfortune
had
reduced
the
family
to
a
state
of
total
despair
and
gregors
only
concern
at
that
time
had
been
to
arrange
things
so
that
they
could
all
forget
about
it
as
quickly
as
possible
so
then
he
started
working
especially
hard
with
a
fiery
vigour
that
raised
him
from
a
junior
salesman
to
a
travelling
representative
almost
overnight
bringing
with
it
the
chance
to
earn
money
in
quite
different
ways
gregor
converted
his
success
at
work
straight
into
cash
that
he
could
lay
on
the
table
at
home
for
the
benefit
of
his
astonished
and
delighted
family
they
had
been
good
times
and
they
had
never
come
again
at
least
not
with
the
same
splendour
even
though
gregor
had
later
earned
so
much
that
he
was
in
a
position
to
bear
the
costs
of
the
whole
family
and
did
bear
them
they
had
even
got
used
to
it
both
gregor
and
the
family
they
took
the
money
with
gratitude
and
he
was
glad
to
provide
it
although
there
was
no
longer
much
warm
affection
given
in
return
gregor
only
remained
close
to
his
sister
now
unlike
him
she
was
very
fond
of
music
and
a
gifted
and
expressive
violinist
it
was
his
secret
plan
to
send
her
to
the
conservatory
next
year
even
though
it
would
cause
great
expense
that
would
have
to
be
made
up
for
in
some
other
way
during
gregors
short
periods
in
town
conversation
with
his
sister
would
often
turn
to
the
conservatory
but
it
was
only
ever
mentioned
as
a
lovely
dream
that
could
never
be
realised
their
parents
did
not
like
to
hear
this
innocent
talk
but
gregor
thought
about
it
quite
hard
and
decided
he
would
let
them
know
what
he
planned
with
a
grand
announcement
of
it
on
christmas
day
that
was
the
sort
of
totally
pointless
thing
that
went
through
his
mind
in
his
present
state
pressed
upright
against
the
door
and
listening
there
were
times
when
he
simply
became
too
tired
to
continue
listening
when
his
head
would
fall
wearily
against
the
door
and
he
would
pull
it
up
again
with
a
start
as
even
the
slightest
noise
he
caused
would
be
heard
next
door
and
they
would
all
