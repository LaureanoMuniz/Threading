go
silent
whats
that
hes
doing
now
his
father
would
say
after
a
while
clearly
having
gone
over
to
the
door
and
only
then
would
the
interrupted
conversation
slowly
be
taken
up
again
when
explaining
things
his
father
repeated
himself
several
times
partly
because
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
been
occupied
with
these
matters
himself
and
partly
because
gregors
mother
did
not
understand
everything
the
first
time
from
these
repeated
explanations
gregor
learned
to
his
pleasure
that
despite
all
their
misfortunes
there
was
still
some
money
available
from
the
old
days
it
was
not
a
lot
but
it
had
not
been
touched
in
the
meantime
and
some
interest
had
accumulated
besides
that
they
had
not
been
using
up
all
the
money
that
gregor
had
been
bringing
home
every
month
keeping
only
a
little
for
himself
so
that
that
too
had
been
accumulating
behind
the
door
gregor
nodded
with
enthusiasm
in
his
pleasure
at
this
unexpected
thrift
and
caution
he
could
actually
have
used
this
surplus
money
to
reduce
his
fathers
debt
to
his
boss
and
the
day
when
he
could
have
freed
himself
from
that
job
would
have
come
much
closer
but
now
it
was
certainly
better
the
way
his
father
had
done
things
this
money
however
was
certainly
not
enough
to
enable
the
family
to
live
off
the
interest
it
was
enough
to
maintain
them
for
perhaps
one
or
two
years
no
more
thats
to
say
it
was
money
that
should
not
really
be
touched
but
set
aside
for
emergencies
money
to
live
on
had
to
be
earned
his
father
was
healthy
but
old
and
lacking
in
self
confidence
during
the
five
years
that
he
had
not
been
working

the
first
holiday
in
a
life
that
had
been
full
of
strain
and
no
success

he
had
put
on
a
lot
of
weight
and
become
very
slow
and
clumsy
would
gregors
elderly
mother
now
have
to
go
and
earn
money
she
suffered
from
asthma
and
it
was
a
strain
for
her
just
to
move
about
the
home
every
other
day
would
be
spent
struggling
for
breath
on
the
sofa
by
the
open
window
would
his
sister
have
to
go
and
earn
money
she
was
still
a
child
of
seventeen
her
life
up
till
then
had
been
very
enviable
consisting
of
wearing
nice
clothes
sleeping
late
helping
out
in
the
business
joining
in
with
a
few
modest
pleasures
and
most
of
all
playing
the
violin
whenever
they
began
to
talk
of
the
need
to
earn
money
gregor
would
always
first
let
go
of
the
door
and
then
throw
himself
onto
the
cool
leather
sofa
next
to
it
as
he
became
quite
hot
with
shame
and
regret
he
would
often
lie
there
the
whole
night
through
not
sleeping
a
wink
but
scratching
at
the
leather
for
hours
on
end
or
he
might
go
to
all
the
effort
of
pushing
a
chair
to
the
window
climbing
up
onto
the
sill
and
propped
up
in
the
chair
leaning
on
the
window
to
stare
out
of
it
he
had
used
to
feel
a
great
sense
of
freedom
from
doing
this
but
doing
it
now
was
obviously
something
more
remembered
than
experienced
as
what
he
actually
saw
in
this
way
was
becoming
less
distinct
every
day
even
things
that
were
quite
near
he
had
used
to
curse
the
everpresent
view
of
the
hospital
across
the
street
but
now
he
could
not
see
it
at
all
and
if
he
had
not
known
that
he
lived
in
charlottenstrasse
which
was
a
quiet
street
despite
being
in
the
middle
of
the
city
he
could
have
thought
that
he
was
looking
out
the
window
at
a
barren
waste
where
the
grey
sky
and
the
grey
earth
mingled
inseparably
his
observant
sister
only
needed
to
notice
the
chair
twice
before
she
would
always
push
it
back
to
its
exact
position
by
the
window
after
she
had
tidied
up
the
room
and
even
left
the
inner
pane
of
the
window
open
from
then
on
if
gregor
had
only
been
able
to
speak
to
his
sister
and
thank
her
for
all
that
she
had
to
do
for
him
it
would
have
been
easier
for
him
to
bear
it
but
as
it
was
it
caused
him
pain
his
sister
naturally
tried
as
far
as
possible
to
pretend
there
was
nothing
burdensome
about
it
and
the
longer
it
went
on
of
course
the
better
she
was
able
to
do
so
but
as
time
went
by
gregor
was
also
able
to
see
through
it
all
so
much
better
it
had
even
become
very
unpleasant
for
him
now
whenever
she
entered
the
room
no
sooner
had
she
come
in
than
she
would
quickly
close
the
door
as
a
precaution
so
that
noone
would
have
to
suffer
the
view
into
gregors
room
then
she
would
go
straight
to
the
window
and
pull
it
hurriedly
open
almost
as
if
she
were
suffocating
even
if
it
was
cold
she
would
stay
at
the
window
breathing
deeply
for
a
little
while
she
would
alarm
gregor
twice
a
day
with
this
running
about
and
noise
making
he
would
stay
under
the
couch
shivering
the
whole
while
knowing
full
well
that
she
would
certainly
have
liked
to
spare
him
this
ordeal
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
him
with
the
windows
closed
one
day
about
a
month
after
gregors
transformation
when
his
sister
no
longer
had
any
particular
reason
to
be
shocked
at
his
appearance
she
came
into
the
room
a
little
earlier
than
usual
and
found
him
still
staring
out
the
window
motionless
and
just
where
he
would
be
most
horrible
in
itself
his
sisters
not
coming
into
the
room
would
have
been
no
surprise
for
gregor
as
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
her
to
immediately
open
the
window
while
he
was
still
there
but
not
only
did
she
not
come
in
she
went
straight
back
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
a
stranger
would
have
thought
he
had
threatened
her
and
tried
to
bite
her
gregor
went
straight
to
hide
himself
under
the
couch
of
course
but
he
had
to
wait
until
midday
before
his
sister
came
back
and
she
seemed
much
more
uneasy
than
usual
it
made
him
realise
that
she
still
found
his
appearance
unbearable
and
would
continue
to
do
so
she
probably
even
had
to
overcome
the
urge
to
flee
when
she
saw
the
little
bit
of
him
that
protruded
from
under
the
couch
one
day
in
order
to
spare
her
even
this
sight
he
spent
four
hours
carrying
the
bedsheet
over
to
the
couch
on
his
back
and
