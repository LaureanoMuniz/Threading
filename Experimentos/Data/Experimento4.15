crossed
in
front
of
her
from
then
on
she
never
failed
to
open
the
door
slightly
every
evening
and
morning
and
look
briefly
in
on
him
at
first
she
would
call
to
him
as
she
did
so
with
words
that
she
probably
considered
friendly
such
as
come
on
then
you
old
dungbeetle
or
look
at
the
old
dungbeetle
there
gregor
never
responded
to
being
spoken
to
in
that
way
but
just
remained
where
he
was
without
moving
as
if
the
door
had
never
even
been
opened
if
only
they
had
told
this
charwoman
to
clean
up
his
room
every
day
instead
of
letting
her
disturb
him
for
no
reason
whenever
she
felt
like
it
one
day
early
in
the
morning
while
a
heavy
rain
struck
the
windowpanes
perhaps
indicating
that
spring
was
coming
she
began
to
speak
to
him
in
that
way
once
again
gregor
was
so
resentful
of
it
that
he
started
to
move
toward
her
he
was
slow
and
infirm
but
it
was
like
a
kind
of
attack
instead
of
being
afraid
the
charwoman
just
lifted
up
one
of
the
chairs
from
near
the
door
and
stood
there
with
her
mouth
open
clearly
intending
not
to
close
her
mouth
until
the
chair
in
her
hand
had
been
slammed
down
into
gregors
back
arent
you
coming
any
closer
then
she
asked
when
gregor
turned
round
again
and
she
calmly
put
the
chair
back
in
the
corner
gregor
had
almost
entirely
stopped
eating
only
if
he
happened
to
find
himself
next
to
the
food
that
had
been
prepared
for
him
he
might
take
some
of
it
into
his
mouth
to
play
with
it
leave
it
there
a
few
hours
and
then
more
often
than
not
spit
it
out
again
at
first
he
thought
it
was
distress
at
the
state
of
his
room
that
stopped
him
eating
but
he
had
soon
got
used
to
the
changes
made
there
they
had
got
into
the
habit
of
putting
things
into
this
room
that
they
had
no
room
for
anywhere
else
and
there
were
now
many
such
things
as
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
flat
had
been
rented
out
to
three
gentlemen
these
earnest
gentlemen

all
three
of
them
had
full
beards
as
gregor
learned
peering
through
the
crack
in
the
door
one
day

were
painfully
insistent
on
things
being
tidy
this
meant
not
only
in
their
own
room
but
since
they
had
taken
a
room
in
this
establishment
in
the
entire
flat
and
especially
in
the
kitchen
unnecessary
clutter
was
something
they
could
not
tolerate
especially
if
it
was
dirty
they
had
moreover
brought
most
of
their
own
furnishings
and
equipment
with
them
for
this
reason
many
things
had
become
superfluous
which
although
they
could
not
be
sold
the
family
did
not
wish
to
discard
all
these
things
found
their
way
into
gregors
room
the
dustbins
from
the
kitchen
found
their
way
in
there
too
the
charwoman
was
always
in
a
hurry
and
anything
she
couldnt
use
for
the
time
being
she
would
just
chuck
in
there
he
fortunately
would
usually
see
no
more
than
the
object
and
the
hand
that
held
it
the
woman
most
likely
meant
to
fetch
the
things
back
out
again
when
she
had
time
and
the
opportunity
or
to
throw
everything
out
in
one
go
but
what
actually
happened
was
that
they
were
left
where
they
landed
when
they
had
first
been
thrown
unless
gregor
made
his
way
through
the
junk
and
moved
it
somewhere
else
at
first
he
moved
it
because
with
no
other
room
free
where
he
could
crawl
about
he
was
forced
to
but
later
on
he
came
to
enjoy
it
although
moving
about
in
that
way
left
him
sad
and
tired
to
death
and
he
would
remain
immobile
for
hours
afterwards
the
gentlemen
who
rented
the
room
would
sometimes
take
their
evening
meal
at
home
in
the
living
room
that
was
used
by
everyone
and
so
the
door
to
this
room
was
often
kept
closed
in
the
evening
but
gregor
found
it
easy
to
give
up
having
the
door
open
he
had
after
all
often
failed
to
make
use
of
it
when
it
was
open
and
without
the
family
having
noticed
it
lain
in
his
room
in
its
darkest
corner
one
time
though
the
charwoman
left
the
door
to
the
living
room
slightly
open
and
it
remained
open
when
the
gentlemen
who
rented
the
room
came
in
in
the
evening
and
the
light
was
put
on
they
sat
up
at
the
table
where
formerly
gregor
had
taken
his
meals
with
his
father
and
mother
they
unfolded
the
serviettes
and
picked
up
their
knives
and
forks
gregors
mother
immediately
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
a
dish
of
meat
and
soon
behind
her
came
his
sister
with
a
dish
piled
high
with
potatoes
the
food
was
steaming
and
filled
the
room
with
its
smell
the
gentlemen
bent
over
the
dishes
set
in
front
of
them
as
if
they
wanted
to
test
the
food
before
eating
it
and
the
gentleman
in
the
middle
who
seemed
to
count
as
an
authority
for
the
other
two
did
indeed
cut
off
a
piece
of
meat
while
it
was
still
in
its
dish
clearly
wishing
to
establish
whether
it
was
sufficiently
cooked
or
whether
it
should
be
sent
back
to
the
kitchen
it
was
to
his
satisfaction
and
gregors
mother
and
sister
who
had
been
looking
on
anxiously
began
to
breathe
again
and
smiled
the
family
themselves
ate
in
the
kitchen
nonetheless
gregors
father
came
into
the
living
room
before
he
went
into
the
kitchen
bowed
once
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
and
did
his
round
of
the
table
the
gentlemen
stood
as
one
and
mumbled
something
into
their
beards
then
once
they
were
alone
they
ate
in
near
perfect
silence
it
seemed
remarkable
to
gregor
that
above
all
the
various
noises
of
eating
their
chewing
teeth
could
still
be
heard
as
if
they
had
wanted
to
show
gregor
that
you
need
teeth
in
order
to
eat
and
it
was
not
possible
to
perform
anything
with
jaws
that
are
toothless
however
nice
they
might
be
id
like
to
eat
something
said
gregor
anxiously
but
not
anything
like
theyre
eating
they
do
feed
themselves
and
here
i
am
dying
throughout
all
this
time
gregor
could
not
remember
having
heard
the
violin
being
played
but
this
evening
it
began
to
be
heard
from
the
kitchen
the
three
gentlemen
had
already
finished
their
meal
the
one
in
the
middle
had
produced
a
newspaper
given
a
page
to
each
of
the
others
and
now
they
leant
back
in
their
chairs
reading
them
and
smoking
when
