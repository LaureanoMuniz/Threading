became
even
smaller
so
now
the
maid
was
dismissed
an
enormous
thickboned
charwoman
with
white
hair
that
flapped
around
her
head
came
every
morning
and
evening
to
do
the
heaviest
work
everything
else
was
looked
after
by
gregors
mother
on
top
of
the
large
amount
of
sewing
work
she
did
gregor
even
learned
listening
to
the
evening
conversation
about
what
price
they
had
hoped
for
that
several
items
of
jewellery
belonging
to
the
family
had
been
sold
even
though
both
mother
and
sister
had
been
very
fond
of
wearing
them
at
functions
and
celebrations
but
the
loudest
complaint
was
that
although
the
flat
was
much
too
big
for
their
present
circumstances
they
could
not
move
out
of
it
there
was
no
imaginable
way
of
transferring
gregor
to
the
new
address
he
could
see
quite
well
though
that
there
were
more
reasons
than
consideration
for
him
that
made
it
difficult
for
them
to
move
it
would
have
been
quite
easy
to
transport
him
in
any
suitable
crate
with
a
few
air
holes
in
it
the
main
thing
holding
the
family
back
from
their
decision
to
move
was
much
more
to
do
with
their
total
despair
and
the
thought
that
they
had
been
struck
with
a
misfortune
unlike
anything
experienced
by
anyone
else
they
knew
or
were
related
to
they
carried
out
absolutely
everything
that
the
world
expects
from
poor
people
gregors
father
brought
bank
employees
their
breakfast
his
mother
sacrificed
herself
by
washing
clothes
for
strangers
his
sister
ran
back
and
forth
behind
her
desk
at
the
behest
of
the
customers
but
they
just
did
not
have
the
strength
to
do
any
more
and
the
injury
in
gregors
back
began
to
hurt
as
much
as
when
it
was
new
after
they
had
come
back
from
taking
his
father
to
bed
gregors
mother
and
sister
would
now
leave
their
work
where
it
was
and
sit
close
together
cheek
to
cheek
his
mother
would
point
to
gregors
room
and
say
close
that
door
grete
and
then
when
he
was
in
the
dark
again
they
would
sit
in
the
next
room
and
their
tears
would
mingle
or
they
would
simply
sit
there
staring
dryeyed
at
the
table
gregor
hardly
slept
at
all
either
night
or
day
sometimes
he
would
think
of
taking
over
the
familys
affairs
just
like
before
the
next
time
the
door
was
opened
he
had
long
forgotten
about
his
boss
and
the
chief
clerk
but
they
would
appear
again
in
his
thoughts
the
salesmen
and
the
apprentices
that
stupid
teaboy
two
or
three
friends
from
other
businesses
one
of
the
chambermaids
from
a
provincial
hotel
a
tender
memory
that
appeared
and
disappeared
again
a
cashier
from
a
hat
shop
for
whom
his
attention
had
been
serious
but
too
slow

all
of
them
appeared
to
him
mixed
together
with
strangers
and
others
he
had
forgotten
but
instead
of
helping
him
and
his
family
they
were
all
of
them
inaccessible
and
he
was
glad
when
they
disappeared
other
times
he
was
not
at
all
in
the
mood
to
look
after
his
family
he
was
filled
with
simple
rage
about
the
lack
of
attention
he
was
shown
and
although
he
could
think
of
nothing
he
would
have
wanted
he
made
plans
of
how
he
could
get
into
the
pantry
where
he
could
take
all
the
things
he
was
entitled
to
even
if
he
was
not
hungry
gregors
sister
no
longer
thought
about
how
she
could
please
him
but
would
hurriedly
push
some
food
or
other
into
his
room
with
her
foot
before
she
rushed
out
to
work
in
the
morning
and
at
midday
and
in
the
evening
she
would
sweep
it
away
again
with
the
broom
indifferent
as
to
whether
it
had
been
eaten
or

more
often
than
not

had
been
left
totally
untouched
she
still
cleared
up
the
room
in
the
evening
but
now
she
could
not
have
been
any
quicker
about
it
smears
of
dirt
were
left
on
the
walls
here
and
there
were
little
balls
of
dust
and
filth
at
first
gregor
went
into
one
of
the
worst
of
these
places
when
his
sister
arrived
as
a
reproach
to
her
but
he
could
have
stayed
there
for
weeks
without
his
sister
doing
anything
about
it
she
could
see
the
dirt
as
well
as
he
could
but
she
had
simply
decided
to
leave
him
to
it
at
the
same
time
she
became
touchy
in
a
way
that
was
quite
new
for
her
and
which
everyone
in
the
family
understood

cleaning
up
gregors
room
was
for
her
and
her
alone
gregors
mother
did
once
thoroughly
clean
his
room
and
needed
to
use
several
bucketfuls
of
water
to
do
it

although
that
much
dampness
also
made
gregor
ill
and
he
lay
flat
on
the
couch
bitter
and
immobile
but
his
mother
was
to
be
punished
still
more
for
what
she
had
done
as
hardly
had
his
sister
arrived
home
in
the
evening
than
she
noticed
the
change
in
gregors
room
and
highly
aggrieved
ran
back
into
the
living
room
where
despite
her
mothers
raised
and
imploring
hands
she
broke
into
convulsive
tears
her
father
of
course
was
startled
out
of
his
chair
and
the
two
parents
looked
on
astonished
and
helpless
then
they
too
became
agitated
gregors
father
standing
to
the
right
of
his
mother
accused
her
of
not
leaving
the
cleaning
of
gregors
room
to
his
sister
from
her
left
gregors
sister
screamed
at
her
that
she
was
never
to
clean
gregors
room
again
while
his
mother
tried
to
draw
his
father
who
was
beside
himself
with
anger
into
the
bedroom
his
sister
quaking
with
tears
thumped
on
the
table
with
her
small
fists
and
gregor
hissed
in
anger
that
noone
had
even
thought
of
closing
the
door
to
save
him
the
sight
of
this
and
all
its
noise
gregors
sister
was
exhausted
from
going
out
to
work
and
looking
after
gregor
as
she
had
done
before
was
even
more
work
for
her
but
even
so
his
mother
ought
certainly
not
to
have
taken
her
place
gregor
on
the
other
hand
ought
not
to
be
neglected
now
though
the
charwoman
was
here
this
elderly
widow
with
a
robust
bone
structure
that
made
her
able
to
withstand
the
hardest
of
things
in
her
long
life
wasnt
really
repelled
by
gregor
just
by
chance
one
day
rather
than
any
real
curiosity
she
opened
the
door
to
gregors
room
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
him
he
was
taken
totally
by
surprise
noone
was
chasing
him
but
he
began
to
rush
to
and
fro
while
she
just
stood
there
in
amazement
with
her
hands
