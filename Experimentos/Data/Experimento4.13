himself
than
running
he
almost
forgot
that
the
walls
were
there
for
him
to
use
although
here
they
were
concealed
behind
carefully
carved
furniture
full
of
notches
and
protrusions

then
right
beside
him
lightly
tossed
something
flew
down
and
rolled
in
front
of
him
it
was
an
apple
then
another
one
immediately
flew
at
him
gregor
froze
in
shock
there
was
no
longer
any
point
in
running
as
his
father
had
decided
to
bombard
him
he
had
filled
his
pockets
with
fruit
from
the
bowl
on
the
sideboard
and
now
without
even
taking
the
time
for
careful
aim
threw
one
apple
after
another
these
little
red
apples
rolled
about
on
the
floor
knocking
into
each
other
as
if
they
had
electric
motors
an
apple
thrown
without
much
force
glanced
against
gregors
back
and
slid
off
without
doing
any
harm
another
one
however
immediately
following
it
hit
squarely
and
lodged
in
his
back
gregor
wanted
to
drag
himself
away
as
if
he
could
remove
the
surprising
the
incredible
pain
by
changing
his
position
but
he
felt
as
if
nailed
to
the
spot
and
spread
himself
out
all
his
senses
in
confusion
the
last
thing
he
saw
was
the
door
of
his
room
being
pulled
open
his
sister
was
screaming
his
mother
ran
out
in
front
of
her
in
her
blouse
as
his
sister
had
taken
off
some
of
her
clothes
after
she
had
fainted
to
make
it
easier
for
her
to
breathe
she
ran
to
his
father
her
skirts
unfastened
and
sliding
one
after
another
to
the
ground
stumbling
over
the
skirts
she
pushed
herself
to
his
father
her
arms
around
him
uniting
herself
with
him
totally

now
gregor
lost
his
ability
to
see
anything

her
hands
behind
his
fathers
head
begging
him
to
spare
gregors
life
iii
noone
dared
to
remove
the
apple
lodged
in
gregors
flesh
so
it
remained
there
as
a
visible
reminder
of
his
injury
he
had
suffered
it
there
for
more
than
a
month
and
his
condition
seemed
serious
enough
to
remind
even
his
father
that
gregor
despite
his
current
sad
and
revolting
form
was
a
family
member
who
could
not
be
treated
as
an
enemy
on
the
contrary
as
a
family
there
was
a
duty
to
swallow
any
revulsion
for
him
and
to
be
patient
just
to
be
patient
because
of
his
injuries
gregor
had
lost
much
of
his
mobility

probably
permanently
he
had
been
reduced
to
the
condition
of
an
ancient
invalid
and
it
took
him
long
long
minutes
to
crawl
across
his
room

crawling
over
the
ceiling
was
out
of
the
question

but
this
deterioration
in
his
condition
was
fully
in
his
opinion
made
up
for
by
the
door
to
the
living
room
being
left
open
every
evening
he
got
into
the
habit
of
closely
watching
it
for
one
or
two
hours
before
it
was
opened
and
then
lying
in
the
darkness
of
his
room
where
he
could
not
be
seen
from
the
living
room
he
could
watch
the
family
in
the
light
of
the
dinner
table
and
listen
to
their
conversation

with
everyones
permission
in
a
way
and
thus
quite
differently
from
before
they
no
longer
held
the
lively
conversations
of
earlier
times
of
course
the
ones
that
gregor
always
thought
about
with
longing
when
he
was
tired
and
getting
into
the
damp
bed
in
some
small
hotel
room
all
of
them
were
usually
very
quiet
nowadays
soon
after
dinner
his
father
would
go
to
sleep
in
his
chair
his
mother
and
sister
would
urge
each
other
to
be
quiet
his
mother
bent
deeply
under
the
lamp
would
sew
fancy
underwear
for
a
fashion
shop
his
sister
who
had
taken
a
sales
job
learned
shorthand
and
french
in
the
evenings
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
get
a
better
position
later
on
sometimes
his
father
would
wake
up
and
say
to
gregors
mother
youre
doing
so
much
sewing
again
today
as
if
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
been
dozing

and
then
he
would
go
back
to
sleep
again
while
mother
and
sister
would
exchange
a
tired
grin
with
a
kind
of
stubbornness
gregors
father
refused
to
take
his
uniform
off
even
at
home
while
his
nightgown
hung
unused
on
its
peg
gregors
father
would
slumber
where
he
was
fully
dressed
as
if
always
ready
to
serve
and
expecting
to
hear
the
voice
of
his
superior
even
here
the
uniform
had
not
been
new
to
start
with
but
as
a
result
of
this
it
slowly
became
even
shabbier
despite
the
efforts
of
gregors
mother
and
sister
to
look
after
it
gregor
would
often
spend
the
whole
evening
looking
at
all
the
stains
on
this
coat
with
its
gold
buttons
always
kept
polished
and
shiny
while
the
old
man
in
it
would
sleep
highly
uncomfortable
but
peaceful
as
soon
as
it
struck
ten
gregors
mother
would
speak
gently
to
his
father
to
wake
him
and
try
to
persuade
him
to
go
to
bed
as
he
couldnt
sleep
properly
where
he
was
and
he
really
had
to
get
his
sleep
if
he
was
to
be
up
at
six
to
get
to
work
but
since
he
had
been
in
work
he
had
become
more
obstinate
and
would
always
insist
on
staying
longer
at
the
table
even
though
he
regularly
fell
asleep
and
it
was
then
harder
than
ever
to
persuade
him
to
exchange
the
chair
for
his
bed
then
however
much
mother
and
sister
would
importune
him
with
little
reproaches
and
warnings
he
would
keep
slowly
shaking
his
head
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
his
eyes
closed
and
refusing
to
get
up
gregors
mother
would
tug
at
his
sleeve
whisper
endearments
into
his
ear
gregors
sister
would
leave
her
work
to
help
her
mother
but
nothing
would
have
any
effect
on
him
he
would
just
sink
deeper
into
his
chair
only
when
the
two
women
took
him
under
the
arms
he
would
abruptly
open
his
eyes
look
at
them
one
after
the
other
and
say
what
a
life
this
is
what
peace
i
get
in
my
old
age
and
supported
by
the
two
women
he
would
lift
himself
up
carefully
as
if
he
were
carrying
the
greatest
load
himself
let
the
women
take
him
to
the
door
send
them
off
and
carry
on
by
himself
while
gregors
mother
would
throw
down
her
needle
and
his
sister
her
pen
so
that
they
could
run
after
his
father
and
continue
being
of
help
to
him
who
in
this
tired
and
overworked
family
would
have
had
time
to
give
more
attention
to
gregor
than
was
absolutely
necessary
the
household
budget
