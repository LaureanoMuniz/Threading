the
easier
hearing
these
words
from
his
mother
made
gregor
realise
that
the
lack
of
any
direct
human
communication
along
with
the
monotonous
life
led
by
the
family
during
these
two
months
must
have
made
him
confused

he
could
think
of
no
other
way
of
explaining
to
himself
why
he
had
seriously
wanted
his
room
emptied
out
had
he
really
wanted
to
transform
his
room
into
a
cave
a
warm
room
fitted
out
with
the
nice
furniture
he
had
inherited
that
would
have
let
him
crawl
around
unimpeded
in
any
direction
but
it
would
also
have
let
him
quickly
forget
his
past
when
he
had
still
been
human
he
had
come
very
close
to
forgetting
and
it
had
only
been
the
voice
of
his
mother
unheard
for
so
long
that
had
shaken
him
out
of
it
nothing
should
be
removed
everything
had
to
stay
he
could
not
do
without
the
good
influence
the
furniture
had
on
his
condition
and
if
the
furniture
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
crawl
about
mindlessly
that
was
not
a
loss
but
a
great
advantage
his
sister
unfortunately
did
not
agree
she
had
become
used
to
the
idea
not
without
reason
that
she
was
gregors
spokesman
to
his
parents
about
the
things
that
concerned
him
this
meant
that
his
mothers
advice
now
was
sufficient
reason
for
her
to
insist
on
removing
not
only
the
chest
of
drawers
and
the
desk
as
she
had
thought
at
first
but
all
the
furniture
apart
from
the
allimportant
couch
it
was
more
than
childish
perversity
of
course
or
the
unexpected
confidence
she
had
recently
acquired
that
made
her
insist
she
had
indeed
noticed
that
gregor
needed
a
lot
of
room
to
crawl
about
in
whereas
the
furniture
as
far
as
anyone
could
see
was
of
no
use
to
him
at
all
girls
of
that
age
though
do
become
enthusiastic
about
things
and
feel
they
must
get
their
way
whenever
they
can
perhaps
this
was
what
tempted
grete
to
make
gregors
situation
seem
even
more
shocking
than
it
was
so
that
she
could
do
even
more
for
him
grete
would
probably
be
the
only
one
who
would
dare
enter
a
room
dominated
by
gregor
crawling
about
the
bare
walls
by
himself
so
she
refused
to
let
her
mother
dissuade
her
gregors
mother
already
looked
uneasy
in
his
room
she
soon
stopped
speaking
and
helped
gregors
sister
to
get
the
chest
of
drawers
out
with
what
strength
she
had
the
chest
of
drawers
was
something
that
gregor
could
do
without
if
he
had
to
but
the
writing
desk
had
to
stay
hardly
had
the
two
women
pushed
the
chest
of
drawers
groaning
out
of
the
room
than
gregor
poked
his
head
out
from
under
the
couch
to
see
what
he
could
do
about
it
he
meant
to
be
as
careful
and
considerate
as
he
could
but
unfortunately
it
was
his
mother
who
came
back
first
while
grete
in
the
next
room
had
her
arms
round
the
chest
pushing
and
pulling
at
it
from
side
to
side
by
herself
without
of
course
moving
it
an
inch
his
mother
was
not
used
to
the
sight
of
gregor
he
might
have
made
her
ill
so
gregor
hurried
backwards
to
the
far
end
of
the
couch
in
his
startlement
though
he
was
not
able
to
prevent
the
sheet
at
its
front
from
moving
a
little
it
was
enough
to
attract
his
mothers
attention
she
stood
very
still
remained
there
a
moment
and
then
went
back
out
to
grete
gregor
kept
trying
to
assure
himself
that
nothing
unusual
was
happening
it
was
just
a
few
pieces
of
furniture
being
moved
after
all
but
he
soon
had
to
admit
that
the
women
going
to
and
fro
their
little
calls
to
each
other
the
scraping
of
the
furniture
on
the
floor
all
these
things
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
being
assailed
from
all
sides
with
his
head
and
legs
pulled
in
against
him
and
his
body
pressed
to
the
floor
he
was
forced
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
could
not
stand
all
of
this
much
longer
they
were
emptying
his
room
out
taking
away
everything
that
was
dear
to
him
they
had
already
taken
out
the
chest
containing
his
fretsaw
and
other
tools
now
they
threatened
to
remove
the
writing
desk
with
its
place
clearly
worn
into
the
floor
the
desk
where
he
had
done
his
homework
as
a
business
trainee
at
high
school
even
while
he
had
been
at
infant
schoolhe
really
could
not
wait
any
longer
to
see
whether
the
two
womens
intentions
were
good
he
had
nearly
forgotten
they
were
there
anyway
as
they
were
now
too
tired
to
say
anything
while
they
worked
and
he
could
only
hear
their
feet
as
they
stepped
heavily
on
the
floor
so
while
the
women
were
leant
against
the
desk
in
the
other
room
catching
their
breath
he
sallied
out
changed
direction
four
times
not
knowing
what
he
should
save
first
before
his
attention
was
suddenly
caught
by
the
picture
on
the
wall

which
was
already
denuded
of
everything
else
that
had
been
on
it

of
the
lady
dressed
in
copious
fur
he
hurried
up
onto
the
picture
and
pressed
himself
against
its
glass
it
held
him
firmly
and
felt
good
on
his
hot
belly
this
picture
at
least
now
totally
covered
by
gregor
would
certainly
be
taken
away
by
noone
he
turned
his
head
to
face
the
door
into
the
living
room
so
that
he
could
watch
the
women
when
they
came
back
they
had
not
allowed
themselves
a
long
rest
and
came
back
quite
soon
grete
had
put
her
arm
around
her
mother
and
was
nearly
carrying
her
what
shall
we
take
now
then
said
grete
and
looked
around
her
eyes
met
those
of
gregor
on
the
wall
perhaps
only
because
her
mother
was
there
she
remained
calm
bent
her
face
to
her
so
that
she
would
not
look
round
and
said
albeit
hurriedly
and
with
a
tremor
in
her
voice
come
on
lets
go
back
in
the
living
room
for
a
while
gregor
could
see
what
grete
had
in
mind
she
wanted
to
take
her
mother
somewhere
safe
and
then
chase
him
down
from
the
wall
well
she
could
certainly
try
it
he
sat
unyielding
on
his
picture
he
would
rather
jump
at
gretes
face
but
gretes
words
had
made
her
mother
quite
worried
she
stepped
to
one
side
saw
the
enormous
brown
patch
against
the
flowers
of
the
wallpaper
and
before
she
even
realised
it
was
gregor
that
she
saw
screamed
oh
god
oh
god
arms
outstretched
she
fell
onto
the
couch
