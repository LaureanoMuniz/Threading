had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
abandoning
his
family
for
the
time
being
he
just
lay
there
on
the
carpet
and
noone
who
knew
the
condition
he
was
in
would
seriously
have
expected
him
to
let
the
chief
clerk
in
it
was
only
a
minor
discourtesy
and
a
suitable
excuse
could
easily
be
found
for
it
later
on
it
was
not
something
for
which
gregor
could
be
sacked
on
the
spot
and
it
seemed
to
gregor
much
more
sensible
to
leave
him
now
in
peace
instead
of
disturbing
him
with
talking
at
him
and
crying
but
the
others
didnt
know
what
was
happening
they
were
worried
that
would
excuse
their
behaviour
the
chief
clerk
now
raised
his
voice
mr
samsa
he
called
to
him
what
is
wrong
you
barricade
yourself
in
your
room
give
us
no
more
than
yes
or
no
for
an
answer
you
are
causing
serious
and
unnecessary
concern
to
your
parents
and
you
fail

and
i
mention
this
just
by
the
way

you
fail
to
carry
out
your
business
duties
in
a
way
that
is
quite
unheard
of
im
speaking
here
on
behalf
of
your
parents
and
of
your
employer
and
really
must
request
a
clear
and
immediate
explanation
i
am
astonished
quite
astonished
i
thought
i
knew
you
as
a
calm
and
sensible
person
and
now
you
suddenly
seem
to
be
showing
off
with
peculiar
whims
this
morning
your
employer
did
suggest
a
possible
reason
for
your
failure
to
appear
its
true

it
had
to
do
with
the
money
that
was
recently
entrusted
to
you

but
i
came
near
to
giving
him
my
word
of
honour
that
that
could
not
be
the
right
explanation
but
now
that
i
see
your
incomprehensible
stubbornness
i
no
longer
feel
any
wish
whatsoever
to
intercede
on
your
behalf
and
nor
is
your
position
all
that
secure
i
had
originally
intended
to
say
all
this
to
you
in
private
but
since
you
cause
me
to
waste
my
time
here
for
no
good
reason
i
dont
see
why
your
parents
should
not
also
learn
of
it
your
turnover
has
been
very
unsatisfactory
of
late
i
grant
you
that
its
not
the
time
of
year
to
do
especially
good
business
we
recognise
that
but
there
simply
is
no
time
of
year
to
do
no
business
at
all
mr
samsa
we
cannot
allow
there
to
be
but
sir
called
gregor
beside
himself
and
forgetting
all
else
in
the
excitement
ill
open
up
immediately
just
a
moment
im
slightly
unwell
an
attack
of
dizziness
i
havent
been
able
to
get
up
im
still
in
bed
now
im
quite
fresh
again
now
though
im
just
getting
out
of
bed
just
a
moment
be
patient
its
not
quite
as
easy
as
id
thought
im
quite
alright
now
though
its
shocking
what
can
suddenly
happen
to
a
person
i
was
quite
alright
last
night
my
parents
know
about
it
perhaps
better
than
me
i
had
a
small
symptom
of
it
last
night
already
they
must
have
noticed
it
i
dont
know
why
i
didnt
let
you
know
at
work
but
you
always
think
you
can
get
over
an
illness
without
staying
at
home
please
dont
make
my
parents
suffer
theres
no
basis
for
any
of
the
accusations
youre
making
nobodys
ever
said
a
word
to
me
about
any
of
these
things
maybe
you
havent
read
the
latest
contracts
i
sent
in
ill
set
off
with
the
eight
oclock
train
as
well
these
few
hours
of
rest
have
given
me
strength
you
dont
need
to
wait
sir
ill
be
in
the
office
soon
after
you
and
please
be
so
good
as
to
tell
that
to
the
boss
and
recommend
me
to
him
and
while
gregor
gushed
out
these
words
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
saying
he
made
his
way
over
to
the
chest
of
drawers

this
was
easily
done
probably
because
of
the
practise
he
had
already
had
in
bed

where
he
now
tried
to
get
himself
upright
he
really
did
want
to
open
the
door
really
did
want
to
let
them
see
him
and
to
speak
with
the
chief
clerk
the
others
were
being
so
insistent
and
he
was
curious
to
learn
what
they
would
say
when
they
caught
sight
of
him
if
they
were
shocked
then
it
would
no
longer
be
gregors
responsibility
and
he
could
rest
if
however
they
took
everything
calmly
he
would
still
have
no
reason
to
be
upset
and
if
he
hurried
he
really
could
be
at
the
station
for
eight
oclock
the
first
few
times
he
tried
to
climb
up
on
the
smooth
chest
of
drawers
he
just
slid
down
again
but
he
finally
gave
himself
one
last
swing
and
stood
there
upright
the
lower
part
of
his
body
was
in
serious
pain
but
he
no
longer
gave
any
attention
to
it
now
he
let
himself
fall
against
the
back
of
a
nearby
chair
and
held
tightly
to
the
edges
of
it
with
his
little
legs
by
now
he
had
also
calmed
down
and
kept
quiet
so
that
he
could
listen
to
what
the
chief
clerk
was
saying
did
you
understand
a
word
of
all
that
the
chief
clerk
asked
his
parents
surely
hes
not
trying
to
make
fools
of
us
oh
god
called
his
mother
who
was
already
in
tears
he
could
be
seriously
ill
and
were
making
him
suffer
grete
grete
she
then
cried
mother
his
sister
called
from
the
other
side
they
communicated
across
gregors
room
youll
have
to
go
for
the
doctor
straight
away
gregor
is
ill
quick
get
the
doctor
did
you
hear
the
way
gregor
spoke
just
now
that
was
the
voice
of
an
animal
said
the
chief
clerk
with
a
calmness
that
was
in
contrast
with
his
mothers
screams
anna
anna
his
father
called
into
the
kitchen
through
the
entrance
hall
clapping
his
hands
get
a
locksmith
here
now
and
the
two
girls
their
skirts
swishing
immediately
ran
out
through
the
hall
wrenching
open
the
front
door
of
the
flat
as
they
went
how
had
his
sister
managed
to
get
dressed
so
quickly
there
was
no
sound
of
the
door
banging
shut
again
they
must
have
left
it
open
people
often
do
in
homes
where
something
awful
has
happened
gregor
in
contrast
had
become
much
calmer
so
they
couldnt
understand
his
words
any
more
although
they
seemed
clear
enough
to
him
clearer
than
before

perhaps
his
ears
had
become
used
to
the
sound
they
had
realised
though
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
and
were
ready
to
help
the
first
response
to
his
situation
had
been
confident
and
wise
and
that
made
