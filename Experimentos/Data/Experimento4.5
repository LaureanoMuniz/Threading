as
having
a
soft
time
of
it
thats
just
prejudice
but
they
have
no
particular
reason
to
think
better
of
it
but
you
sir
you
have
a
better
overview
than
the
rest
of
the
staff
in
fact
if
i
can
say
this
in
confidence
a
better
overview
than
the
boss
himself

its
very
easy
for
a
businessman
like
him
to
make
mistakes
about
his
employees
and
judge
them
more
harshly
than
he
should
and
youre
also
well
aware
that
we
travellers
spend
almost
the
whole
year
away
from
the
office
so
that
we
can
very
easily
fall
victim
to
gossip
and
chance
and
groundless
complaints
and
its
almost
impossible
to
defend
yourself
from
that
sort
of
thing
we
dont
usually
even
hear
about
them
or
if
at
all
its
when
we
arrive
back
home
exhausted
from
a
trip
and
thats
when
we
feel
the
harmful
effects
of
whats
been
going
on
without
even
knowing
what
caused
them
please
dont
go
away
at
least
first
say
something
to
show
that
you
grant
that
im
at
least
partly
right
but
the
chief
clerk
had
turned
away
as
soon
as
gregor
had
started
to
speak
and
with
protruding
lips
only
stared
back
at
him
over
his
trembling
shoulders
as
he
left
he
did
not
keep
still
for
a
moment
while
gregor
was
speaking
but
moved
steadily
towards
the
door
without
taking
his
eyes
off
him
he
moved
very
gradually
as
if
there
had
been
some
secret
prohibition
on
leaving
the
room
it
was
only
when
he
had
reached
the
entrance
hall
that
he
made
a
sudden
movement
drew
his
foot
from
the
living
room
and
rushed
forward
in
a
panic
in
the
hall
he
stretched
his
right
hand
far
out
towards
the
stairway
as
if
out
there
there
were
some
supernatural
force
waiting
to
save
him
gregor
realised
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
let
the
chief
clerk
go
away
in
this
mood
if
his
position
in
the
firm
was
not
to
be
put
into
extreme
danger
that
was
something
his
parents
did
not
understand
very
well
over
the
years
they
had
become
convinced
that
this
job
would
provide
for
gregor
for
his
entire
life
and
besides
they
had
so
much
to
worry
about
at
present
that
they
had
lost
sight
of
any
thought
for
the
future
gregor
though
did
think
about
the
future
the
chief
clerk
had
to
be
held
back
calmed
down
convinced
and
finally
won
over
the
future
of
gregor
and
his
family
depended
on
it
if
only
his
sister
were
here
she
was
clever
she
was
already
in
tears
while
gregor
was
still
lying
peacefully
on
his
back
and
the
chief
clerk
was
a
lover
of
women
surely
she
could
persuade
him
she
would
close
the
front
door
in
the
entrance
hall
and
talk
him
out
of
his
shocked
state
but
his
sister
was
not
there
gregor
would
have
to
do
the
job
himself
and
without
considering
that
he
still
was
not
familiar
with
how
well
he
could
move
about
in
his
present
state
or
that
his
speech
still
might
not

or
probably
would
not

be
understood
he
let
go
of
the
door
pushed
himself
through
the
opening
tried
to
reach
the
chief
clerk
on
the
landing
who
ridiculously
was
holding
on
to
the
banister
with
both
hands
but
gregor
fell
immediately
over
and
with
a
little
scream
as
he
sought
something
to
hold
onto
landed
on
his
numerous
little
legs
hardly
had
that
happened
than
for
the
first
time
that
day
he
began
to
feel
alright
with
his
body
the
little
legs
had
the
solid
ground
under
them
to
his
pleasure
they
did
exactly
as
he
told
them
they
were
even
making
the
effort
to
carry
him
where
he
wanted
to
go
and
he
was
soon
believing
that
all
his
sorrows
would
soon
be
finally
at
an
end
he
held
back
the
urge
to
move
but
swayed
from
side
to
side
as
he
crouched
there
on
the
floor
his
mother
was
not
far
away
in
front
of
him
and
seemed
at
first
quite
engrossed
in
herself
but
then
she
suddenly
jumped
up
with
her
arms
outstretched
and
her
fingers
spread
shouting
help
for
pitys
sake
help
the
way
she
held
her
head
suggested
she
wanted
to
see
gregor
better
but
the
unthinking
way
she
was
hurrying
backwards
showed
that
she
did
not
she
had
forgotten
that
the
table
was
behind
her
with
all
the
breakfast
things
on
it
when
she
reached
the
table
she
sat
quickly
down
on
it
without
knowing
what
she
was
doing
without
even
seeming
to
notice
that
the
coffee
pot
had
been
knocked
over
and
a
gush
of
coffee
was
pouring
down
onto
the
carpet
mother
mother
said
gregor
gently
looking
up
at
her
he
had
completely
forgotten
the
chief
clerk
for
the
moment
but
could
not
help
himself
snapping
in
the
air
with
his
jaws
at
the
sight
of
the
flow
of
coffee
that
set
his
mother
screaming
anew
she
fled
from
the
table
and
into
the
arms
of
his
father
as
he
rushed
towards
her
gregor
though
had
no
time
to
spare
for
his
parents
now
the
chief
clerk
had
already
reached
the
stairs
with
his
chin
on
the
banister
he
looked
back
for
the
last
time
gregor
made
a
run
for
him
he
wanted
to
be
sure
of
reaching
him
the
chief
clerk
must
have
expected
something
as
he
leapt
down
several
steps
at
once
and
disappeared
his
shouts
resounding
all
around
the
staircase
the
flight
of
the
chief
clerk
seemed
unfortunately
to
put
gregors
father
into
a
panic
as
well
until
then
he
had
been
relatively
self
controlled
but
now
instead
of
running
after
the
chief
clerk
himself
or
at
least
not
impeding
gregor
as
he
ran
after
him
gregors
father
seized
the
chief
clerks
stick
in
his
right
hand
the
chief
clerk
had
left
it
behind
on
a
chair
along
with
his
hat
and
overcoat
picked
up
a
large
newspaper
from
the
table
with
his
left
and
used
them
to
drive
gregor
back
into
his
room
stamping
his
foot
at
him
as
he
went
gregors
appeals
to
his
father
were
of
no
help
his
appeals
were
simply
not
understood
however
much
he
humbly
turned
his
head
his
father
merely
stamped
his
foot
all
the
harder
across
the
room
despite
the
chilly
weather
gregors
mother
had
pulled
open
a
window
leant
far
out
of
it
and
pressed
her
hands
to
her
face
a
strong
draught
of
air
flew
in
from
the
street
towards
the
stairway
the
curtains
flew
up
the
newspapers
on
the
table
fluttered
and
some
of
them
were
