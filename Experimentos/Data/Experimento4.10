arranged
it
so
that
he
was
completely
covered
and
his
sister
would
not
be
able
to
see
him
even
if
she
bent
down
if
she
did
not
think
this
sheet
was
necessary
then
all
she
had
to
do
was
take
it
off
again
as
it
was
clear
enough
that
it
was
no
pleasure
for
gregor
to
cut
himself
off
so
completely
she
left
the
sheet
where
it
was
gregor
even
thought
he
glimpsed
a
look
of
gratitude
one
time
when
he
carefully
looked
out
from
under
the
sheet
to
see
how
his
sister
liked
the
new
arrangement
for
the
first
fourteen
days
gregors
parents
could
not
bring
themselves
to
come
into
the
room
to
see
him
he
would
often
hear
them
say
how
they
appreciated
all
the
new
work
his
sister
was
doing
even
though
before
they
had
seen
her
as
a
girl
who
was
somewhat
useless
and
frequently
been
annoyed
with
her
but
now
the
two
of
them
father
and
mother
would
often
both
wait
outside
the
door
of
gregors
room
while
his
sister
tidied
up
in
there
and
as
soon
as
she
went
out
again
she
would
have
to
tell
them
exactly
how
everything
looked
what
gregor
had
eaten
how
he
had
behaved
this
time
and
whether
perhaps
any
slight
improvement
could
be
seen
his
mother
also
wanted
to
go
in
and
visit
gregor
relatively
soon
but
his
father
and
sister
at
first
persuaded
her
against
it
gregor
listened
very
closely
to
all
this
and
approved
fully
later
though
she
had
to
be
held
back
by
force
which
made
her
call
out
let
me
go
and
see
gregor
he
is
my
unfortunate
son
cant
you
understand
i
have
to
see
him
and
gregor
would
think
to
himself
that
maybe
it
would
be
better
if
his
mother
came
in
not
every
day
of
course
but
one
day
a
week
perhaps
she
could
understand
everything
much
better
than
his
sister
who
for
all
her
courage
was
still
just
a
child
after
all
and
really
might
not
have
had
an
adults
appreciation
of
the
burdensome
job
she
had
taken
on
gregors
wish
to
see
his
mother
was
soon
realised
out
of
consideration
for
his
parents
gregor
wanted
to
avoid
being
seen
at
the
window
during
the
day
the
few
square
meters
of
the
floor
did
not
give
him
much
room
to
crawl
about
it
was
hard
to
just
lie
quietly
through
the
night
his
food
soon
stopped
giving
him
any
pleasure
at
all
and
so
to
entertain
himself
he
got
into
the
habit
of
crawling
up
and
down
the
walls
and
ceiling
he
was
especially
fond
of
hanging
from
the
ceiling
it
was
quite
different
from
lying
on
the
floor
he
could
breathe
more
freely
his
body
had
a
light
swing
to
it
and
up
there
relaxed
and
almost
happy
it
might
happen
that
he
would
surprise
even
himself
by
letting
go
of
the
ceiling
and
landing
on
the
floor
with
a
crash
but
now
of
course
he
had
far
better
control
of
his
body
than
before
and
even
with
a
fall
as
great
as
that
caused
himself
no
damage
very
soon
his
sister
noticed
gregors
new
way
of
entertaining
himself

he
had
after
all
left
traces
of
the
adhesive
from
his
feet
as
he
crawled
about

and
got
it
into
her
head
to
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
for
him
by
removing
the
furniture
that
got
in
his
way
especially
the
chest
of
drawers
and
the
desk
now
this
was
not
something
that
she
would
be
able
to
do
by
herself
she
did
not
dare
to
ask
for
help
from
her
father
the
sixteen
year
old
maid
had
carried
on
bravely
since
the
cook
had
left
but
she
certainly
would
not
have
helped
in
this
she
had
even
asked
to
be
allowed
to
keep
the
kitchen
locked
at
all
times
and
never
to
have
to
open
the
door
unless
it
was
especially
important
so
his
sister
had
no
choice
but
to
choose
some
time
when
gregors
father
was
not
there
and
fetch
his
mother
to
help
her
as
she
approached
the
room
gregor
could
hear
his
mother
express
her
joy
but
once
at
the
door
she
went
silent
first
of
course
his
sister
came
in
and
looked
round
to
see
that
everything
in
the
room
was
alright
and
only
then
did
she
let
her
mother
enter
gregor
had
hurriedly
pulled
the
sheet
down
lower
over
the
couch
and
put
more
folds
into
it
so
that
everything
really
looked
as
if
it
had
just
been
thrown
down
by
chance
gregor
also
refrained
this
time
from
spying
out
from
under
the
sheet
he
gave
up
the
chance
to
see
his
mother
until
later
and
was
simply
glad
that
she
had
come
you
can
come
in
he
cant
be
seen
said
his
sister
obviously
leading
her
in
by
the
hand
the
old
chest
of
drawers
was
too
heavy
for
a
pair
of
feeble
women
to
be
heaving
about
but
gregor
listened
as
they
pushed
it
from
its
place
his
sister
always
taking
on
the
heaviest
part
of
the
work
for
herself
and
ignoring
her
mothers
warnings
that
she
would
strain
herself
this
lasted
a
very
long
time
after
labouring
at
it
for
fifteen
minutes
or
more
his
mother
said
it
would
be
better
to
leave
the
chest
where
it
was
for
one
thing
it
was
too
heavy
for
them
to
get
the
job
finished
before
gregors
father
got
home
and
leaving
it
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
would
be
in
his
way
even
more
and
for
another
thing
it
wasnt
even
sure
that
taking
the
furniture
away
would
really
be
any
help
to
him
she
thought
just
the
opposite
the
sight
of
the
bare
walls
saddened
her
right
to
her
heart
and
why
wouldnt
gregor
feel
the
same
way
about
it
hed
been
used
to
this
furniture
in
his
room
for
a
long
time
and
it
would
make
him
feel
abandoned
to
be
in
an
empty
room
like
that
then
quietly
almost
whispering
as
if
wanting
gregor
whose
whereabouts
she
did
not
know
to
hear
not
even
the
tone
of
her
voice
as
she
was
convinced
that
he
did
not
understand
her
words
she
added
and
by
taking
the
furniture
away
wont
it
seem
like
were
showing
that
weve
given
up
all
hope
of
improvement
and
were
abandoning
him
to
cope
for
himself
i
think
itd
be
best
to
leave
the
room
exactly
the
way
it
was
before
so
that
when
gregor
comes
back
to
us
again
hell
find
everything
unchanged
and
hell
be
able
to
forget
the
time
in
between
all
