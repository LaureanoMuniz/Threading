him
feel
better
he
felt
that
he
had
been
drawn
back
in
among
people
and
from
the
doctor
and
the
locksmith
he
expected
great
and
surprising
achievements

although
he
did
not
really
distinguish
one
from
the
other
whatever
was
said
next
would
be
crucial
so
in
order
to
make
his
voice
as
clear
as
possible
he
coughed
a
little
but
taking
care
to
do
this
not
too
loudly
as
even
this
might
well
sound
different
from
the
way
that
a
human
coughs
and
he
was
no
longer
sure
he
could
judge
this
for
himself
meanwhile
it
had
become
very
quiet
in
the
next
room
perhaps
his
parents
were
sat
at
the
table
whispering
with
the
chief
clerk
or
perhaps
they
were
all
pressed
against
the
door
and
listening
gregor
slowly
pushed
his
way
over
to
the
door
with
the
chair
once
there
he
let
go
of
it
and
threw
himself
onto
the
door
holding
himself
upright
against
it
using
the
adhesive
on
the
tips
of
his
legs
he
rested
there
a
little
while
to
recover
from
the
effort
involved
and
then
set
himself
to
the
task
of
turning
the
key
in
the
lock
with
his
mouth
he
seemed
unfortunately
to
have
no
proper
teeth

how
was
he
then
to
grasp
the
key

but
the
lack
of
teeth
was
of
course
made
up
for
with
a
very
strong
jaw
using
the
jaw
he
really
was
able
to
start
the
key
turning
ignoring
the
fact
that
he
must
have
been
causing
some
kind
of
damage
as
a
brown
fluid
came
from
his
mouth
flowed
over
the
key
and
dripped
onto
the
floor
listen
said
the
chief
clerk
in
the
next
room
hes
turning
the
key
gregor
was
greatly
encouraged
by
this
but
they
all
should
have
been
calling
to
him
his
father
and
his
mother
too
well
done
gregor
they
should
have
cried
keep
at
it
keep
hold
of
the
lock
and
with
the
idea
that
they
were
all
excitedly
following
his
efforts
he
bit
on
the
key
with
all
his
strength
paying
no
attention
to
the
pain
he
was
causing
himself
as
the
key
turned
round
he
turned
around
the
lock
with
it
only
holding
himself
upright
with
his
mouth
and
hung
onto
the
key
or
pushed
it
down
again
with
the
whole
weight
of
his
body
as
needed
the
clear
sound
of
the
lock
as
it
snapped
back
was
gregors
sign
that
he
could
break
his
concentration
and
as
he
regained
his
breath
he
said
to
himself
so
i
didnt
need
the
locksmith
after
all
then
he
lay
his
head
on
the
handle
of
the
door
to
open
it
completely
because
he
had
to
open
the
door
in
this
way
it
was
already
wide
open
before
he
could
be
seen
he
had
first
to
slowly
turn
himself
around
one
of
the
double
doors
and
he
had
to
do
it
very
carefully
if
he
did
not
want
to
fall
flat
on
his
back
before
entering
the
room
he
was
still
occupied
with
this
difficult
movement
unable
to
pay
attention
to
anything
else
when
he
heard
the
chief
clerk
exclaim
a
loud
oh
which
sounded
like
the
soughing
of
the
wind
now
he
also
saw
him

he
was
the
nearest
to
the
door

his
hand
pressed
against
his
open
mouth
and
slowly
retreating
as
if
driven
by
a
steady
and
invisible
force
gregors
mother
her
hair
still
dishevelled
from
bed
despite
the
chief
clerks
being
there
looked
at
his
father
then
she
unfolded
her
arms
took
two
steps
forward
towards
gregor
and
sank
down
onto
the
floor
into
her
skirts
that
spread
themselves
out
around
her
as
her
head
disappeared
down
onto
her
breast
his
father
looked
hostile
and
clenched
his
fists
as
if
wanting
to
knock
gregor
back
into
his
room
then
he
looked
uncertainly
round
the
living
room
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
wept
so
that
his
powerful
chest
shook
so
gregor
did
not
go
into
the
room
but
leant
against
the
inside
of
the
other
door
which
was
still
held
bolted
in
place
in
this
way
only
half
of
his
body
could
be
seen
along
with
his
head
above
it
which
he
leant
over
to
one
side
as
he
peered
out
at
the
others
meanwhile
the
day
had
become
much
lighter
part
of
the
endless
greyblack
building
on
the
other
side
of
the
street

which
was
a
hospital

could
be
seen
quite
clearly
with
the
austere
and
regular
line
of
windows
piercing
its
facade
the
rain
was
still
falling
now
throwing
down
large
individual
droplets
which
hit
the
ground
one
at
a
time
the
washing
up
from
breakfast
lay
on
the
table
there
was
so
much
of
it
because
for
gregors
father
breakfast
was
the
most
important
meal
of
the
day
and
he
would
stretch
it
out
for
several
hours
as
he
sat
reading
a
number
of
different
newspapers
on
the
wall
exactly
opposite
there
was
photograph
of
gregor
when
he
was
a
lieutenant
in
the
army
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
a
carefree
smile
on
his
face
as
he
called
forth
respect
for
his
uniform
and
bearing
the
door
to
the
entrance
hall
was
open
and
as
the
front
door
of
the
flat
was
also
open
he
could
see
onto
the
landing
and
the
stairs
where
they
began
their
way
down
below
now
then
said
gregor
well
aware
that
he
was
the
only
one
to
have
kept
calm
ill
get
dressed
straight
away
now
pack
up
my
samples
and
set
off
will
you
please
just
let
me
leave
you
can
see
he
said
to
the
chief
clerk
that
im
not
stubborn
and
i
like
to
do
my
job
being
a
commercial
traveller
is
arduous
but
without
travelling
i
couldnt
earn
my
living
so
where
are
you
going
in
to
the
office
yes
will
you
report
everything
accurately
then
its
quite
possible
for
someone
to
be
temporarily
unable
to
work
but
thats
just
the
right
time
to
remember
whats
been
achieved
in
the
past
and
consider
that
later
on
once
the
difficulty
has
been
removed
he
will
certainly
work
with
all
the
more
diligence
and
concentration
youre
well
aware
that
im
seriously
in
debt
to
our
employer
as
well
as
having
to
look
after
my
parents
and
my
sister
so
that
im
trapped
in
a
difficult
situation
but
i
will
work
my
way
out
of
it
again
please
dont
make
things
any
harder
for
me
than
they
are
already
and
dont
take
sides
against
me
at
the
office
i
know
that
nobody
likes
the
travellers
they
think
we
earn
an
enormous
wage
as
well
