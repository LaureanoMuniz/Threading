but
it
was
something
that
had
to
be
risked
when
gregor
was
already
sticking
half
way
out
of
the
bed

the
new
method
was
more
of
a
game
than
an
effort
all
he
had
to
do
was
rock
back
and
forth

it
occurred
to
him
how
simple
everything
would
be
if
somebody
came
to
help
him
two
strong
people

he
had
his
father
and
the
maid
in
mind

would
have
been
more
than
enough
they
would
only
have
to
push
their
arms
under
the
dome
of
his
back
peel
him
away
from
the
bed
bend
down
with
the
load
and
then
be
patient
and
careful
as
he
swang
over
onto
the
floor
where
hopefully
the
little
legs
would
find
a
use
should
he
really
call
for
help
though
even
apart
from
the
fact
that
all
the
doors
were
locked
despite
all
the
difficulty
he
was
in
he
could
not
suppress
a
smile
at
this
thought
after
a
while
he
had
already
moved
so
far
across
that
it
would
have
been
hard
for
him
to
keep
his
balance
if
he
rocked
too
hard
the
time
was
now
ten
past
seven
and
he
would
have
to
make
a
final
decision
very
soon
then
there
was
a
ring
at
the
door
of
the
flat
thatll
be
someone
from
work
he
said
to
himself
and
froze
very
still
although
his
little
legs
only
became
all
the
more
lively
as
they
danced
around
for
a
moment
everything
remained
quiet
theyre
not
opening
the
door
gregor
said
to
himself
caught
in
some
nonsensical
hope
but
then
of
course
the
maids
firm
steps
went
to
the
door
as
ever
and
opened
it
gregor
only
needed
to
hear
the
visitors
first
words
of
greeting
and
he
knew
who
it
was

the
chief
clerk
himself
why
did
gregor
have
to
be
the
only
one
condemned
to
work
for
a
company
where
they
immediately
became
highly
suspicious
at
the
slightest
shortcoming
were
all
employees
every
one
of
them
louts
was
there
not
one
of
them
who
was
faithful
and
devoted
who
would
go
so
mad
with
pangs
of
conscience
that
he
couldnt
get
out
of
bed
if
he
didnt
spend
at
least
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
morning
on
company
business
was
it
really
not
enough
to
let
one
of
the
trainees
make
enquiries

assuming
enquiries
were
even
necessary

did
the
chief
clerk
have
to
come
himself
and
did
they
have
to
show
the
whole
innocent
family
that
this
was
so
suspicious
that
only
the
chief
clerk
could
be
trusted
to
have
the
wisdom
to
investigate
it
and
more
because
these
thoughts
had
made
him
upset
than
through
any
proper
decision
he
swang
himself
with
all
his
force
out
of
the
bed
there
was
a
loud
thump
but
it
wasnt
really
a
loud
noise
his
fall
was
softened
a
little
by
the
carpet
and
gregors
back
was
also
more
elastic
than
he
had
thought
which
made
the
sound
muffled
and
not
too
noticeable
he
had
not
held
his
head
carefully
enough
though
and
hit
it
as
he
fell
annoyed
and
in
pain
he
turned
it
and
rubbed
it
against
the
carpet
somethings
fallen
down
in
there
said
the
chief
clerk
in
the
room
on
the
left
gregor
tried
to
imagine
whether
something
of
the
sort
that
had
happened
to
him
today
could
ever
happen
to
the
chief
clerk
too
you
had
to
concede
that
it
was
possible
but
as
if
in
gruff
reply
to
this
question
the
chief
clerks
firm
footsteps
in
his
highly
polished
boots
could
now
be
heard
in
the
adjoining
room
from
the
room
on
his
right
gregors
sister
whispered
to
him
to
let
him
know
gregor
the
chief
clerk
is
here
yes
i
know
said
gregor
to
himself
but
without
daring
to
raise
his
voice
loud
enough
for
his
sister
to
hear
him
gregor
said
his
father
now
from
the
room
to
his
left
the
chief
clerk
has
come
round
and
wants
to
know
why
you
didnt
leave
on
the
early
train
we
dont
know
what
to
say
to
him
and
anyway
he
wants
to
speak
to
you
personally
so
please
open
up
this
door
im
sure
hell
be
good
enough
to
forgive
the
untidiness
of
your
room
then
the
chief
clerk
called
good
morning
mr
samsa
he
isnt
well
said
his
mother
to
the
chief
clerk
while
his
father
continued
to
speak
through
the
door
he
isnt
well
please
believe
me
why
else
would
gregor
have
missed
a
train
the
lad
only
ever
thinks
about
the
business
it
nearly
makes
me
cross
the
way
he
never
goes
out
in
the
evenings
hes
been
in
town
for
a
week
now
but
stayed
home
every
evening
he
sits
with
us
in
the
kitchen
and
just
reads
the
paper
or
studies
train
timetables
his
idea
of
relaxation
is
working
with
his
fretsaw
hes
made
a
little
frame
for
instance
it
only
took
him
two
or
three
evenings
youll
be
amazed
how
nice
it
is
its
hanging
up
in
his
room
youll
see
it
as
soon
as
gregor
opens
the
door
anyway
im
glad
youre
here
we
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
get
gregor
to
open
the
door
by
ourselves
hes
so
stubborn
and
im
sure
he
isnt
well
he
said
this
morning
that
he
is
but
he
isnt
ill
be
there
in
a
moment
said
gregor
slowly
and
thoughtfully
but
without
moving
so
that
he
would
not
miss
any
word
of
the
conversation
well
i
cant
think
of
any
other
way
of
explaining
it
mrs
samsa
said
the
chief
clerk
i
hope
its
nothing
serious
but
on
the
other
hand
i
must
say
that
if
we
people
in
commerce
ever
become
slightly
unwell
then
fortunately
or
unfortunately
as
you
like
we
simply
have
to
overcome
it
because
of
business
considerations
can
the
chief
clerk
come
in
to
see
you
now
then
asked
his
father
impatiently
knocking
at
the
door
again
no
said
gregor
in
the
room
on
his
right
there
followed
a
painful
silence
in
the
room
on
his
left
his
sister
began
to
cry
so
why
did
his
sister
not
go
and
join
the
others
she
had
probably
only
just
got
up
and
had
not
even
begun
to
get
dressed
and
why
was
she
crying
was
it
because
he
had
not
got
up
and
had
not
let
the
chief
clerk
in
because
he
was
in
danger
of
losing
his
job
and
if
that
happened
his
boss
would
once
more
pursue
their
parents
with
the
same
demands
as
before
there
was
no
need
to
worry
about
things
like
that
yet
gregor
was
still
there
and
