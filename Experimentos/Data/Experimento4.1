deep
inside
him
there
was
a
painful
and
uncontrollable
squeaking
mixed
in
with
it
the
words
could
be
made
out
at
first
but
then
there
was
a
sort
of
echo
which
made
them
unclear
leaving
the
hearer
unsure
whether
he
had
heard
properly
or
not
gregor
had
wanted
to
give
a
full
answer
and
explain
everything
but
in
the
circumstances
contented
himself
with
saying
yes
mother
yes
thankyou
im
getting
up
now
the
change
in
gregors
voice
probably
could
not
be
noticed
outside
through
the
wooden
door
as
his
mother
was
satisfied
with
this
explanation
and
shuffled
away
but
this
short
conversation
made
the
other
members
of
the
family
aware
that
gregor
against
their
expectations
was
still
at
home
and
soon
his
father
came
knocking
at
one
of
the
side
doors
gently
but
with
his
fist
gregor
gregor
he
called
whats
wrong
and
after
a
short
while
he
called
again
with
a
warning
deepness
in
his
voice
gregor
gregor
at
the
other
side
door
his
sister
came
plaintively
gregor
arent
you
well
do
you
need
anything
gregor
answered
to
both
sides
im
ready
now
making
an
effort
to
remove
all
the
strangeness
from
his
voice
by
enunciating
very
carefully
and
putting
long
pauses
between
each
individual
word
his
father
went
back
to
his
breakfast
but
his
sister
whispered
gregor
open
the
door
i
beg
of
you
gregor
however
had
no
thought
of
opening
the
door
and
instead
congratulated
himself
for
his
cautious
habit
acquired
from
his
travelling
of
locking
all
doors
at
night
even
when
he
was
at
home
the
first
thing
he
wanted
to
do
was
to
get
up
in
peace
without
being
disturbed
to
get
dressed
and
most
of
all
to
have
his
breakfast
only
then
would
he
consider
what
to
do
next
as
he
was
well
aware
that
he
would
not
bring
his
thoughts
to
any
sensible
conclusions
by
lying
in
bed
he
remembered
that
he
had
often
felt
a
slight
pain
in
bed
perhaps
caused
by
lying
awkwardly
but
that
had
always
turned
out
to
be
pure
imagination
and
he
wondered
how
his
imaginings
would
slowly
resolve
themselves
today
he
did
not
have
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
change
in
his
voice
was
nothing
more
than
the
first
sign
of
a
serious
cold
which
was
an
occupational
hazard
for
travelling
salesmen
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
throw
off
the
covers
he
only
had
to
blow
himself
up
a
little
and
they
fell
off
by
themselves
but
it
became
difficult
after
that
especially
as
he
was
so
exceptionally
broad
he
would
have
used
his
arms
and
his
hands
to
push
himself
up
but
instead
of
them
he
only
had
all
those
little
legs
continuously
moving
in
different
directions
and
which
he
was
moreover
unable
to
control
if
he
wanted
to
bend
one
of
them
then
that
was
the
first
one
that
would
stretch
itself
out
and
if
he
finally
managed
to
do
what
he
wanted
with
that
leg
all
the
others
seemed
to
be
set
free
and
would
move
about
painfully
this
is
something
that
cant
be
done
in
bed
gregor
said
to
himself
so
dont
keep
trying
to
do
it
the
first
thing
he
wanted
to
do
was
get
the
lower
part
of
his
body
out
of
the
bed
but
he
had
never
seen
this
lower
part
and
could
not
imagine
what
it
looked
like
it
turned
out
to
be
too
hard
to
move
it
went
so
slowly
and
finally
almost
in
a
frenzy
when
he
carelessly
shoved
himself
forwards
with
all
the
force
he
could
gather
he
chose
the
wrong
direction
hit
hard
against
the
lower
bedpost
and
learned
from
the
burning
pain
he
felt
that
the
lower
part
of
his
body
might
well
at
present
be
the
most
sensitive
so
then
he
tried
to
get
the
top
part
of
his
body
out
of
the
bed
first
carefully
turning
his
head
to
the
side
this
he
managed
quite
easily
and
despite
its
breadth
and
its
weight
the
bulk
of
his
body
eventually
followed
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
head
but
when
he
had
at
last
got
his
head
out
of
the
bed
and
into
the
fresh
air
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
let
himself
fall
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
his
head
were
not
injured
so
he
became
afraid
to
carry
on
pushing
himself
forward
the
same
way
and
he
could
not
knock
himself
out
now
at
any
price
better
to
stay
in
bed
than
lose
consciousness
it
took
just
as
much
effort
to
get
back
to
where
he
had
been
earlier
but
when
he
lay
there
sighing
and
was
once
more
watching
his
legs
as
they
struggled
against
each
other
even
harder
than
before
if
that
was
possible
he
could
think
of
no
way
of
bringing
peace
and
order
to
this
chaos
he
told
himself
once
more
that
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
stay
in
bed
and
that
the
most
sensible
thing
to
do
would
be
to
get
free
of
it
in
whatever
way
he
could
at
whatever
sacrifice
at
the
same
time
though
he
did
not
forget
to
remind
himself
that
calm
consideration
was
much
better
than
rushing
to
desperate
conclusions
at
times
like
this
he
would
direct
his
eyes
to
the
window
and
look
out
as
clearly
as
he
could
but
unfortunately
even
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
street
was
enveloped
in
morning
fog
and
the
view
had
little
confidence
or
cheer
to
offer
him
seven
oclock
already
he
said
to
himself
when
the
clock
struck
again
seven
oclock
and
theres
still
a
fog
like
this
and
he
lay
there
quietly
a
while
longer
breathing
lightly
as
if
he
perhaps
expected
the
total
stillness
to
bring
things
back
to
their
real
and
natural
state
but
then
he
said
to
himself
before
it
strikes
quarter
past
seven
ill
definitely
have
to
have
got
properly
out
of
bed
and
by
then
somebody
will
have
come
round
from
work
to
ask
whats
happened
to
me
as
well
as
they
open
up
at
work
before
seven
oclock
and
so
he
set
himself
to
the
task
of
swinging
the
entire
length
of
his
body
out
of
the
bed
all
at
the
same
time
if
he
succeeded
in
falling
out
of
bed
in
this
way
and
kept
his
head
raised
as
he
did
so
he
could
probably
avoid
injuring
it
his
back
seemed
to
be
quite
hard
and
probably
nothing
would
happen
to
it
falling
onto
the
carpet
his
main
concern
was
for
the
loud
noise
he
was
bound
to
make
and
which
even
through
all
the
doors
would
probably
raise
concern
if
not
alarm
