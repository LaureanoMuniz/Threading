blown
onto
the
floor
nothing
would
stop
gregors
father
as
he
drove
him
back
making
hissing
noises
at
him
like
a
wild
man
gregor
had
never
had
any
practice
in
moving
backwards
and
was
only
able
to
go
very
slowly
if
gregor
had
only
been
allowed
to
turn
round
he
would
have
been
back
in
his
room
straight
away
but
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
took
the
time
to
do
that
his
father
would
become
impatient
and
there
was
the
threat
of
a
lethal
blow
to
his
back
or
head
from
the
stick
in
his
fathers
hand
any
moment
eventually
though
gregor
realised
that
he
had
no
choice
as
he
saw
to
his
disgust
that
he
was
quite
incapable
of
going
backwards
in
a
straight
line
so
he
began
as
quickly
as
possible
and
with
frequent
anxious
glances
at
his
father
to
turn
himself
round
it
went
very
slowly
but
perhaps
his
father
was
able
to
see
his
good
intentions
as
he
did
nothing
to
hinder
him
in
fact
now
and
then
he
used
the
tip
of
his
stick
to
give
directions
from
a
distance
as
to
which
way
to
turn
if
only
his
father
would
stop
that
unbearable
hissing
it
was
making
gregor
quite
confused
when
he
had
nearly
finished
turning
round
still
listening
to
that
hissing
he
made
a
mistake
and
turned
himself
back
a
little
the
way
he
had
just
come
he
was
pleased
when
he
finally
had
his
head
in
front
of
the
doorway
but
then
saw
that
it
was
too
narrow
and
his
body
was
too
broad
to
get
through
it
without
further
difficulty
in
his
present
mood
it
obviously
did
not
occur
to
his
father
to
open
the
other
of
the
double
doors
so
that
gregor
would
have
enough
space
to
get
through
he
was
merely
fixed
on
the
idea
that
gregor
should
be
got
back
into
his
room
as
quickly
as
possible
nor
would
he
ever
have
allowed
gregor
the
time
to
get
himself
upright
as
preparation
for
getting
through
the
doorway
what
he
did
making
more
noise
than
ever
was
to
drive
gregor
forwards
all
the
harder
as
if
there
had
been
nothing
in
the
way
it
sounded
to
gregor
as
if
there
was
now
more
than
one
father
behind
him
it
was
not
a
pleasant
experience
and
gregor
pushed
himself
into
the
doorway
without
regard
for
what
might
happen
one
side
of
his
body
lifted
itself
he
lay
at
an
angle
in
the
doorway
one
flank
scraped
on
the
white
door
and
was
painfully
injured
leaving
vile
brown
flecks
on
it
soon
he
was
stuck
fast
and
would
not
have
been
able
to
move
at
all
by
himself
the
little
legs
along
one
side
hung
quivering
in
the
air
while
those
on
the
other
side
were
pressed
painfully
against
the
ground
then
his
father
gave
him
a
hefty
shove
from
behind
which
released
him
from
where
he
was
held
and
sent
him
flying
and
heavily
bleeding
deep
into
his
room
the
door
was
slammed
shut
with
the
stick
then
finally
all
was
quiet
ii
it
was
not
until
it
was
getting
dark
that
evening
that
gregor
awoke
from
his
deep
and
comalike
sleep
he
would
have
woken
soon
afterwards
anyway
even
if
he
hadnt
been
disturbed
as
he
had
had
enough
sleep
and
felt
fully
rested
but
he
had
the
impression
that
some
hurried
steps
and
the
sound
of
the
door
leading
into
the
front
room
being
carefully
shut
had
woken
him
the
light
from
the
electric
street
lamps
shone
palely
here
and
there
onto
the
ceiling
and
tops
of
the
furniture
but
down
below
where
gregor
was
it
was
dark
he
pushed
himself
over
to
the
door
feeling
his
way
clumsily
with
his
antennae

of
which
he
was
now
beginning
to
learn
the
value

in
order
to
see
what
had
been
happening
there
the
whole
of
his
left
side
seemed
like
one
painfully
stretched
scar
and
he
limped
badly
on
his
two
rows
of
legs
one
of
the
legs
had
been
badly
injured
in
the
events
of
that
morning

it
was
nearly
a
miracle
that
only
one
of
them
had
been

and
dragged
along
lifelessly
it
was
only
when
he
had
reached
the
door
that
he
realised
what
it
actually
was
that
had
drawn
him
over
to
it
it
was
the
smell
of
something
to
eat
by
the
door
there
was
a
dish
filled
with
sweetened
milk
with
little
pieces
of
white
bread
floating
in
it
he
was
so
pleased
he
almost
laughed
as
he
was
even
hungrier
than
he
had
been
that
morning
and
immediately
dipped
his
head
into
the
milk
nearly
covering
his
eyes
with
it
but
he
soon
drew
his
head
back
again
in
disappointment
not
only
did
the
pain
in
his
tender
left
side
make
it
difficult
to
eat
the
food

he
was
only
able
to
eat
if
his
whole
body
worked
together
as
a
snuffling
whole

but
the
milk
did
not
taste
at
all
nice
milk
like
this
was
normally
his
favourite
drink
and
his
sister
had
certainly
left
it
there
for
him
because
of
that
but
he
turned
almost
against
his
own
will
away
from
the
dish
and
crawled
back
into
the
centre
of
the
room
through
the
crack
in
the
door
gregor
could
see
that
the
gas
had
been
lit
in
the
living
room
his
father
at
this
time
would
normally
be
sat
with
his
evening
paper
reading
it
out
in
a
loud
voice
to
gregors
mother
and
sometimes
to
his
sister
but
there
was
now
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
gregors
sister
would
often
write
and
tell
him
about
this
reading
but
maybe
his
father
had
lost
the
habit
in
recent
times
it
was
so
quiet
all
around
too
even
though
there
must
have
been
somebody
in
the
flat
what
a
quiet
life
it
is
the
family
lead
said
gregor
to
himself
and
gazing
into
the
darkness
felt
a
great
pride
that
he
was
able
to
provide
a
life
like
that
in
such
a
nice
home
for
his
sister
and
parents
but
what
now
if
all
this
peace
and
wealth
and
comfort
should
come
to
a
horrible
and
frightening
end
that
was
something
that
gregor
did
not
want
to
think
about
too
much
so
he
started
to
move
about
crawling
up
and
down
the
room
once
during
that
long
evening
the
door
on
one
side
of
the
room
was
opened
very
slightly
and
hurriedly
closed
again
later
on
the
door
on
the
other
side
did
the
same
it
seemed
that
someone
needed
to
enter
the
room
but
thought
better
