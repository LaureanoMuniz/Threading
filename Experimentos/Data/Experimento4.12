as
if
she
had
given
up
everything
and
stayed
there
immobile
gregor
shouted
his
sister
glowering
at
him
and
shaking
her
fist
that
was
the
first
word
she
had
spoken
to
him
directly
since
his
transformation
she
ran
into
the
other
room
to
fetch
some
kind
of
smelling
salts
to
bring
her
mother
out
of
her
faint
gregor
wanted
to
help
too

he
could
save
his
picture
later
although
he
stuck
fast
to
the
glass
and
had
to
pull
himself
off
by
force
then
he
too
ran
into
the
next
room
as
if
he
could
advise
his
sister
like
in
the
old
days
but
he
had
to
just
stand
behind
her
doing
nothing
she
was
looking
into
various
bottles
he
startled
her
when
she
turned
round
a
bottle
fell
to
the
ground
and
broke
a
splinter
cut
gregors
face
some
kind
of
caustic
medicine
splashed
all
over
him
now
without
delaying
any
longer
grete
took
hold
of
all
the
bottles
she
could
and
ran
with
them
in
to
her
mother
she
slammed
the
door
shut
with
her
foot
so
now
gregor
was
shut
out
from
his
mother
who
because
of
him
might
be
near
to
death
he
could
not
open
the
door
if
he
did
not
want
to
chase
his
sister
away
and
she
had
to
stay
with
his
mother
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
wait
and
oppressed
with
anxiety
and
selfreproach
he
began
to
crawl
about
he
crawled
over
everything
walls
furniture
ceiling
and
finally
in
his
confusion
as
the
whole
room
began
to
spin
around
him
he
fell
down
into
the
middle
of
the
dinner
table
he
lay
there
for
a
while
numb
and
immobile
all
around
him
it
was
quiet
maybe
that
was
a
good
sign
then
there
was
someone
at
the
door
the
maid
of
course
had
locked
herself
in
her
kitchen
so
that
grete
would
have
to
go
and
answer
it
his
father
had
arrived
home
whats
happened
were
his
first
words
gretes
appearance
must
have
made
everything
clear
to
him
she
answered
him
with
subdued
voice
and
openly
pressed
her
face
into
his
chest
mothers
fainted
but
shes
better
now
gregor
got
out
just
as
i
expected
said
his
father
just
as
i
always
said
but
you
women
wouldnt
listen
would
you
it
was
clear
to
gregor
that
grete
had
not
said
enough
and
that
his
father
took
it
to
mean
that
something
bad
had
happened
that
he
was
responsible
for
some
act
of
violence
that
meant
gregor
would
now
have
to
try
to
calm
his
father
as
he
did
not
have
the
time
to
explain
things
to
him
even
if
that
had
been
possible
so
he
fled
to
the
door
of
his
room
and
pressed
himself
against
it
so
that
his
father
when
he
came
in
from
the
hall
could
see
straight
away
that
gregor
had
the
best
intentions
and
would
go
back
into
his
room
without
delay
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
drive
him
back
but
that
they
had
only
to
open
the
door
and
he
would
disappear
his
father
though
was
not
in
the
mood
to
notice
subtleties
like
that
ah
he
shouted
as
he
came
in
sounding
as
if
he
were
both
angry
and
glad
at
the
same
time
gregor
drew
his
head
back
from
the
door
and
lifted
it
towards
his
father
he
really
had
not
imagined
his
father
the
way
he
stood
there
now
of
late
with
his
new
habit
of
crawling
about
he
had
neglected
to
pay
attention
to
what
was
going
on
the
rest
of
the
flat
the
way
he
had
done
before
he
really
ought
to
have
expected
things
to
have
changed
but
still
still
was
that
really
his
father
the
same
tired
man
as
used
to
be
laying
there
entombed
in
his
bed
when
gregor
came
back
from
his
business
trips
who
would
receive
him
sitting
in
the
armchair
in
his
nightgown
when
he
came
back
in
the
evenings
who
was
hardly
even
able
to
stand
up
but
as
a
sign
of
his
pleasure
would
just
raise
his
arms
and
who
on
the
couple
of
times
a
year
when
they
went
for
a
walk
together
on
a
sunday
or
public
holiday
wrapped
up
tightly
in
his
overcoat
between
gregor
and
his
mother
would
always
labour
his
way
forward
a
little
more
slowly
than
them
who
were
already
walking
slowly
for
his
sake
who
would
place
his
stick
down
carefully
and
if
he
wanted
to
say
something
would
invariably
stop
and
gather
his
companions
around
him
he
was
standing
up
straight
enough
now
dressed
in
a
smart
blue
uniform
with
gold
buttons
the
sort
worn
by
the
employees
at
the
banking
institute
above
the
high
stiff
collar
of
the
coat
his
strong
doublechin
emerged
under
the
bushy
eyebrows
his
piercing
dark
eyes
looked
out
fresh
and
alert
his
normally
unkempt
white
hair
was
combed
down
painfully
close
to
his
scalp
he
took
his
cap
with
its
gold
monogram
from
probably
some
bank
and
threw
it
in
an
arc
right
across
the
room
onto
the
sofa
put
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
pushing
back
the
bottom
of
his
long
uniform
coat
and
with
look
of
determination
walked
towards
gregor
he
probably
did
not
even
know
himself
what
he
had
in
mind
but
nonetheless
lifted
his
feet
unusually
high
gregor
was
amazed
at
the
enormous
size
of
the
soles
of
his
boots
but
wasted
no
time
with
that

he
knew
full
well
right
from
the
first
day
of
his
new
life
that
his
father
thought
it
necessary
to
always
be
extremely
strict
with
him
and
so
he
ran
up
to
his
father
stopped
when
his
father
stopped
scurried
forwards
again
when
he
moved
even
slightly
in
this
way
they
went
round
the
room
several
times
without
anything
decisive
happening
without
even
giving
the
impression
of
a
chase
as
everything
went
so
slowly
gregor
remained
all
this
time
on
the
floor
largely
because
he
feared
his
father
might
see
it
as
especially
provoking
if
he
fled
onto
the
wall
or
ceiling
whatever
he
did
gregor
had
to
admit
that
he
certainly
would
not
be
able
to
keep
up
this
running
about
for
long
as
for
each
step
his
father
took
he
had
to
carry
out
countless
movements
he
became
noticeably
short
of
breath
even
in
his
earlier
life
his
lungs
had
not
been
very
reliable
now
as
he
lurched
about
in
his
efforts
to
muster
all
the
strength
he
could
for
running
he
could
hardly
keep
his
eyes
open
his
thoughts
became
too
slow
for
him
to
think
of
any
other
way
of
saving
